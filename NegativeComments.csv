False advertising.
Amazon does not honor their own promotions.
 Poor customer services. 
Amazon lately has been showing items as two days ship when I order and a day or two later they still have not shipped. This is ridiculous as it is not even the Holiday yet or BF. 
Very Disappointed at the level of service I have received from Amazon.
 I will never do business with them again
" Good luck and look elsewhere, only order here if you have to."
"""Prime"" items are consistently way overpriced."
"As a loyal customer, the first time i filed a claim with Amazon was so disappointed and unhappy. My returned product was delivered to the seller according to USPS tracking information, however, the seller said they just received a box without ring inside after 7 days they received the mail. The reason i made the returned because the seller didn't attach the IGI Certification as promised, which is so important evidence to approve the quality of diamond. however, Amazon denied my claim to protect their seller, why don't they protect their customers who believe in Amazon's reputation so purchase from the 3rd party. "
"Well it is nice that I can pretty much order anything with one click and it is usually reasonably priced.........my problem is the shipping.  i live in the country so unless its UPS GROUND or FEDEX. USPS and UPS sure post do not have a route to my physical address so the product gets dropped off at the post office for me to pick up.  while that might be an easy situation for most, it's not for me. Our post office which is on the otherside of BFE from where I live is only open 3 hours a day...............yes just 3.  3 while I am at work making money to pay for the products I don't have access to.  I have literally had this happen to 9 out of the last 12 orders!!!!!! and amazon keeps telling me they are making notes on my account, some ""special"" forms where filled out and yet it still happens.  Just like today....so I will spend 2 hours tonight on the phone with customer service AGAIN just to have nothing done about it AGAIN.  I'm done with amazon $99 a year is too much for this crap! So basically if the post office won't deliver to your house DO NOT order from Amazon because you will be right next to me, up a creek with no paddle!!!!! "
"Ordered an OTG cable and a USB hub on 3rd October; should have received them by 12th Oct. Have called Amazon 6-8 times now and every time they say that I will receive them within 24 hrs. The stupid carrier - Ecom Express doesn't even pick up calls. First the tracker said that the delivery went to some wrong hub by mistake, then it wrongfully said that it was delivered but I was not there to receive. To top it all, then the tracker said that I have called and asked that my order be delayed. It is 28th October today and I have lost all hope. Thanks a lot Amazon. In case someone didn't understood all that and the intended sarcasm, allow me to be rather blunt. AMAZON SUCKS. ""Earth's  Most  Customer- Centric Company"" the slogan of Amazon?? ..... BS"
"I made a purchase on 7/29/2015 for an item Amazom.com showed they had stock.  Delivery was said to be 5-7 days.  After 10 days I checked the status of the order and it had not shipped yet.  I spoke to customer service and was told it was an Amazon item and was on order even though when I placed the order they had plenty of stock.  They said it could take 4-6 weeks for the item to arrive and asked if I wanted to cancel the order, which I said no. Today I checked the status of my order and discovered Amazon cancelled the order in mid-September and never notified me.  Amazon has other suppliers selling the same item but at a higher price which they will not match.  This is not a good way to conduct business and I am very dissatisfied with Amazon.com.Beware of any and all purchases you make from Amazon as you may never receive them."
"Purchased a printer on Amazon. Printer arrived in a ""Home Depot"" Box 2X the size with about 12 pieces of newspaper as padding. I contacted the seller over 9 times with no resolution. Printer had arrived smashed. Amazon told me that I had to send it back and pay the shipping. Amazon is horrible to deal with. All they do is email form responses computer generated.Never again will I order from them."
"I have to say that i buy a lot from amazon and rarely have problems, in fact it is nearly always a good experience.  but when there is a problem their customer service seems worthless so i am giving them a poor rating simply because of their customer service.  Case in point--Our credit card company saw some funny charges so they stopped that day's charges and reissued the card.  unfortunately we had some orders that had just shipped from amazon and they completely freaked out.  They sent emails with specific instructions to add the replacement credit card to our account and then reply with the email with the last 2 digits of the new credit card to change the billing over.  Great except they also froze our account so we could not get in.  Several calls and emails to customer service were no help as everyone says they cannot unlock the account.  over a week later and we are still in this endless loop.  pathetic.  Every one of our other vendors handled this in a much more professional manner while amazon came across as being clueless."
"My nightmare started when I first ordered a console from their site, after a week the tracking had shown ""delivered"" yet I did not receive my product. Amazon was quick to send out a replacement so I can receive it before my son's birthday (which is why I purchase the console) and I was very happy at the moment with their customer service. Time has come and the same thing happened (address error? carrier error? someone stealing it off my porch?) and when contacting Amazon I was accused of criminal activity. After several phone calls and plenty of promises I still have not received a refund. My last phone call was dealt with by Tanya who had extreme attitude. Not only was denying all that I've said, she shut the phone in my face after I sarcastically told the rep that it was nice to be told that I would not receive help. She simply said ""thanks, bye bye"" and immediately shut the phone in my face. This will not go unnoticed."
"Amazon is in bed with Google. Try googling ""Amazon Reviews""....good luck...not even Google Plus Reviews are available. Shame on you Gaagle!As to Amazon they are intentionally slowing their shipments to non-plus customers, to push them to pay $99....I know because I have been ordering from them for years.Latest example: today I got an item I ordered from Amazon for $2.99 that was shipped from China that came just one day after the $60 stuff from same order shipped by Amazon from good old USA.!!!???? Go figure. I am still waiting on another item from same order..........I am in Kentucky and its probably coming from Ohio......"
"I registered on amazon.co.uk and try to buy simple Sony Playstation 4. And on next day my account blocked, cause they think what i'm not real. They force me send them information about my card. I'm simple decent woman. Why i must send them this information?!"
"Not happy with Amazon.

It will only take a moment.Me: OKA Customer Service Associate will be with you in a moment.You are now connected to Amazon from Amazon.comMe: HowdyAmazon: Hello, this is Alex. What kind of Price match are you looking for?You can see the link to the Amazon product and the link to your sponsored Ad in the above text.Amazon: that website is not eligible for Price Match.Me: thats why I disagree with you have a sponsored Adon the Amazon web pageAnd you don't have them as a website you will price matchSo I started this chatIf your willing to Sponsor content from there websiteyou should be willing to price match them.Amazon: I'm sorry, but that's the list of eligible retailers.Me: Why are you allowing them to advertise on Amazon.com If you won't price match them?I realize that they are not on the eligible retail list. But you all can't post an Ad for a lower price on a competitor website that you won't match. You all should pull your sponsorship with themor price match it.Amazon: Joe, you already had a list, you can see that the website you showed me is not eligible. I'm sorry, this is not valid and you know it.Me: It feels to me like the sponsored Ad is pretty much a bait and switch tactic.Why would you allow them to advertise on Amazon?Amazon: Did the add says that the website was eligible for a price match?It was just showing the price of the TV from a different websiteMe: I found the Ad on Amazon.com as a Sponsored Ad.Amazon: if you want to go ahead and get it for that price, why don't you purchase the tv from that website?Me: You all were advertising their website. Because they use bait and switch.You all are allowing a bad site to be advertised on Amazon.com and you refuse to price match them.Amazon: Not me; does the policy shows you that the website is eligible for price match?would be my pleasure to send you that link againMe: Sure. And the policy does not list eastcoasttv.com as a website that you are currently price matching from.http://www.eastcoasttvs.com/Sony-LED-HD...(See full link)however I got that link from Amazon.comAmazon: it's from an add.Me: You have it as an Advertised Sponsor.Amazon: I'm sorry, the answer will be the same: is not eligible.Me: I'm telling you that they are bad. I can prove that. They have a terrible history.Amazon: So no, we cannot approve that. I'm sorry.Me: However you are advertising them as a valid sponsored Ad. You are saying they are a good website.By allowing them to Advertise on Amazon.comAmazon: The sponsor add will show you adds about different websites based on your search history or the website were you have beenMe: And on the same exact page as the link to your price.Amazon: same happens when you login into facebook and see an Amazon add.Me: So you all should not all them as a sponsor.Amazon: is not valid, we can't approve it, it's against our policies. Now... Is there something else that I can assist you with?Me: Especially if your not willing to price match.You can make sure there Ad gets pulled.Amazon: Okay, anything else?Amazon: I'm sorry, this is against policy, so we can't approve it. Keep this chat in your history if you want to, but I'm really sorry, we can't approve it.Is not valid, is not an eligible retailer, I'm sorry, but the answer is no."
I will not be using amazin prime again. I used to buy off at least once a week. But they took money out of mine and my boyfriends account for amazing prime without our concent and now our son has to go days without what he needs until they give us our money back. Screw Amazon. 
"Amazon free shipping is the slowest shipping method available, I used to buy from amazon but their shipping times has changed drastically, my last order took three weeks to process and  ship.I made a comparison with Ebay and the same product, same price, free shipping but Ebay shipping was priority mail.  BIG difference."
"This site has gone so far downhill in the past year or so it's not funny.  Extreme shipping times, misrepresented shipping times, wrong items and misrepresented items have been par for the course.  I have had to return 2 out of the past 6 items for being misrepresented on the site.  A current order has shown 9/22 as delivery date.  It's 9/23 and no item.  Amazon's answer is to ""give it a couple more days."""
I once loved ordering from amazon but its going down hill quickly. Im a prime memeber and the last few orders I have placed the package never arrived although it they said it was delivered. I have a door man and a camera for all deliveries. The packages never came. In one occasion the guy delivering it actually called me and to confirm the address he had thought the city (chicago) was the street on the address slip and when I corrected him still no package showed up. When I talked to amazon they said to wait 2 more days and if it still wasn't there they would send me another item. I pay for the prime membership so I can have my packages in 2 days and now its turned into at least 6 day delivery for the last 3 products. I no longer trush this company and will be canceling my membership. 
BEWARE CREDIT CARDS * NEW AMAZON NOT NICE..... I was told I would be refunded for their mistake then my bank charges me an overdraft fee because they went ahead and took the money from my card. And now they are telling me it is my problem not theirs. Beware of the new scam of amazon. I use to love it but now I am scared to even use my credit card with them. 
i purchased a sharp microwave drawer and they canceled my order ..i waited three days to watch for shipping and they all the sudden cancelled with no explanation but was out of stock..it was priced at 899.00 then a slash through it said now 699.00 i bought. i bought and applied for amazon store credit .. it went right through .. now they have cancelled the item because i believe it was a false advertising as when i questioned them about it they said had no more..now i only see online for 1000.00 plus so my personal opinion is they decided not to accept my payment of 699.00..it was the price they made it i bought it and now two days later no microwave..never again with amazon to many third parties maybe not so much on the up and up..see ya amazon.ALL CUSTOMER SERVICE DID FOR ME WAS TELL ME I WAS SCREWED OUT OF THE ITEM .. discount direct was the seller ... poor seller
"Amazon has some good items and prices but their delivery team - Amazon Logistics let them down. This particular order, the delivery man left my item outside the porch in the open air when I have requested it to be place inside the porch as a secured place.  Previous within the last 12 month, there had been 2 failed deliveries. Both times the delivery did not take place on the day they promised and I am a prime customer. "
"If I could give them 0 stars I would. Purchased aluminum diamond plate pickup truck bed rail protectors through Amazon from a company in GA named East Coast Jeeps. Parts arrived on 3 August, 2015 damaged so I contacted Amazon and East Coast Jeeps. It should have been easy to return damaged parts due to improper packaging, not so. They wanted pictures on two different occasions. Due to a lack of cooperation by East Coast Jeeps, I filed an A-Z guarantee with Amazon on 7 August. East Coast Jeeps delayed filing a damage claim with UPS until 10 August. I returned the parts via UPS on 12 August and immediately informed East Coast Jeeps and Amazon of the parts being out of my hands as I was requested to do. Here it is 17 August and East Coast Jeeps hasn't returned an email since 11 August and Amazon just tells me ""they are looking into the matter"" but no refund. Let it be known that East Coast Jeeps is selling parts that have been returned and are incomplete and are repackaging them and selling them as ""new"". The part I received was missing numerous parts and instructions let alone that it was not packaged with any protection inside the box, Not the way it came from the manufacturer. I am disgusted with Amazon. I have not been on hold with them for almost 30 minutes and no supervisor is available to deal with this issue. Guess if they ignore me I will go away."
"Amazon.com is an overpriced store that claims to offer ""free shipping"" for Prime Members, yet they encourage sellers to include the shipping price in the cost of the item. Everything is much more expensive than your local grocery store. Additionally, if you complain, they go back and delete all of your consumer reviews to try and ""punish"" you. MAJOR review manipulation. Closing my Amazon account today!"
"Amazon used to be great. I used to rave about Prime and its benefits. But recently, things have changed. Prime is no longer two days. Logistics are a nightmare. Shipping is problematic.Case and point: I received a notification on my phone today (a Saturday) that UPS had made a delivery attempt (at 8am...on a Saturday). I didn't hear the bell, but I looked outside, and there was no evidence of a delivery attempt. I called UPS, and they said they've handed it off to the Post Office so it's their problem. As an Amazon customer, this amounts to a terrible experience on my end.Like I said, things didn't used to be this way. Amazon WAS great. They are no longer. I've set my Prime membership to expire, and will be moving as many of my purchases as possible away from Amazon to other retailers (both online and local)."
"Well, I bought HP ink from Amazon. I installed it in my ALL in One 6180 printer, which worked perfectly until now, and the cartridges leaked and ruined the printer. I place a review and Amazon refused to post it, saying it went against their policy. I guess the truth is not allowed. Here is the review that they refused:Ruined my printer. Leaked on first test. August 2015, August 3, 2015By C. S. Bastian (San Diego)Verified Purchase(What's this?)This review is from: LD © Remanufactured Replacement for Hewlett Packard (HP) 02 Ink Cartridges Set of 6 : 1 Black C8721WN, Cyan C8771WN, Magenta C8772WN, Yellow C8773WN, Light Cyan C8774WN, Light Magenta C8775WN (Office Product)This product should not be offered on Amazon. It has just ruined my printer. I may stop shopping on amazon if they do not offer to make good on replacement of my printer.I will add, I am waiting to see how the resolve this with me, but am extremely disappointed in the refusal to post a honest review. There is nothing abusive in it, and this hurts my trust in the company. Amazon apologized for my misfortune but will do nothing but replace the ink. Ink for a printer that no longer works. If I bought this ink from HP they would be replacing my printer. LD inks ruined my printer. and I now know my shopping on amazon comes with the same dangerous as buy from a stranger on craigslist. I have been a loyal shopper of Amazon and loved them up til now. A defective product manufactured to mimic HP destroyed my product. Looking back I don't see how this was not a counterfeit ink cartridges, as it registered as genuine HP, but is not. So is Amazon selling knock offs? Another question to consider. I plan on investigating this, and if there are violations pursue them.  "
"Amazon has terrible policies. Especially their product review and return policy for sellers. Anyone in the world can go and give a product review on your product if there have ever purchased a product or not. What ends up happening is competition gives negative reviews under different names and agree customers about your policies make up negative reviews for revenge. As far as the return policy goes amazon sends you one email if a claim is opened and if you do not reply with in 7 days they give the buyer a full refund and let him keep the product no maker what the cost is or if there is actually something wrong with the product. Amazon should at least send more than one email it is easy to miss one email when you receive 10's of them from amazon daily, they should review the case before refunding, and should require the buyer to return the item before giving a refund. Ebay has much better return policy so if you want to sell stick to ebay. Amazon with suck away all your profits with their ridiculous policies"
"I am beyond disappointed with Amazon. I’ve purchased before and have spent a lot of money with you and this experience left a horrible taste in my mouth.  I paid for next day shipping on this item. I waited the whole day and it never showed up. I call the next morning 7/16/2015 and Amazon said it was out for delivery. I needed this item for an event that was taking place that weekend. I waited and waited on 7/16/2015 and I had to end up calling them back. They finally confirmed with UPS that this package is likely lost in transit. “ I spoke with a supervisor name Catherine and she said that would ship out a unit that WOULD ARRIVE the next business morning.  When they sent the order number for the replacement order, it showed that it wouldn’t arrive until the following week. When I called back, a manager came on the phone and said that the information provided was incorrect. This ruined the entire weekend and put a major strain on the event. This is by FAR the worst experience I’ve ever had with AMAZON!"

"Used to be biggest Amazon.com Fan...convinced many family and friends to become a prime member but I am done after this experience...Placed an ordered with next day shipping and 3 days later; there is no delivery and being told TOMORROW and TOMORROW by their department called customer service,"
"Edit on 08/10/2015:  In the past I always said that you can't beat Amazon customer service. No longer true for me, makes me wonder what is going on at Amazon. Amazon seems to be messing up more and more of late - poor packaging, items not as described from Amazon Warehouse deals, wrong items shipped and terrible customer service. It used to be easier, but not cheaper, to shop at Amazon than to buy from a local brick and mortar store but just not worth it anymore to me.Only makes sense to me to buy items that cost less than ~$10 from Amazon or bargain priced items.I plan on shopping online elsewhere and buying more locally. Many big box stores offer a free ship to store option. Seems easier to me to drive in to town to pick up purchases than to deal with the now, IMHO, terrible customer service from Amazon and then have to drive into town to drop the returns off at the UPS store or post office. Either way you end up doing a trip to town, why not buy for less locally or do a price match locally?Mistakes happen, just part of life, what matters to me is how mistakes are handled. IMHO Amazon no longer is dealing with their mistakes in a timely and fair manner.Guaranteed delivery dates are hit or miss, best Amazon seems to do is give you another month of Prime and more late deliveries.BTW I don't plan on renewing my Prime subscription come renewal time. Always have had Prime set not to auto renew which is the closest you can get to canceling. Prime is not like a a big name warehouse store membership, they will refund the membership fee if you are not happy, Amazon will not refund the fee to unhappy customers. Amazon fails to provide what you paid for and still keeps the $99 Prime membership fee...-----------------------Old Review:By reading reviews of amazon.com here it seems that many still don't understand that anyone can be a third party seller on Amazon.  IMHO buying from a third party seller on amazon, newegg, best buy, walmart or other etailers is like buying from an eBay seller.  Safest to just buy products that are ""sold and shipped by amazon.com"" and skip buying from third party sellers that might be scammers.I spend way too much at Amazon.  Every once in a while they do make an error but so far errors have been resolved quickly and fairly with a friendly email or sometimes two.Finally joined Prime about a year and a half ago.  Orders get to me quicker and every now and then I watch some of the movies and TV shows that Prime members get for free.  Selection of Prime videos is not great but oh well, you get what you get.  Prime videos are an added benefit, not their main business.Only difference I have noticed since joining Prime, other than the extra benefits like Prime instant video, is that packages leave the warehouse days sooner.  Customer service is just as good as before I joined Prime, 5 star plus!I tend to buy ""Sold and Shipped by Amazon.com"" products or every now and then something sold by a third party seller if Amazon is doing the shipping.    Buying directly from third party Amazon sellers usually is, to me,  like buying from someone selling stuff out of their bedroom on a famous Internet auction site. Got to love Amazon's customer service, of all the etailers I have shopped at for many years not one has exceeded Amazon when it comes to customer service.   If the little guys did half as well as Amazon I'd shop elsewhere more often as I would prefer to buy from small businesses instead of a big corporation.   A lot of small etailer's don't seem to have caught on how to do customer service and seem to want to start an argument rather than dealing fairly in a timely manner with issues.  A recent issue I had with returning a product that was shipped in error from an etailer that specializes in selling closeout tools has reminded me just what a great job Amazon actually does.  Almost seems to me as if the small etailers would rather people buy from Amazon rather than from them at times.9 time out of 10 Amazon prices seem to be lower than local or what shows up on a Google search.  I do get charged sales tax at Amazon  but still Amazon is usually the cheapest unless some etailer is selling what I am looking for for a limited time special price.Amazon has missed the promised delivery date a couple of time but a quick email to Amazon customer service has always resulted in a small cash credit being added to my account."
I am done buying from Amazon.  I used to get a lot of stuff through them but since they are trying to sell you Amazon Prime they don't ship it right away if you don't have Prime.  I have no intention of paying for Prime.   Before I used to receive things in a week or less from when I ordered it.  My order wasn't even shipped until 16 days after I ordered it.  Once it was shipped it only 4 days including a weekend.  I can get things from China faster than that!  That also means I am going to stop using their credit card.
The rudeness these they show customers .after they screw up your order is unbelievable. We recently ordered 6 brides made dresses.paid in advance.we was told they would be of great quality and a rive in a couple of weeks..3 weeks later we received two they was okay and what I ordered.a week later got one more dress low quality bad!!!.the wrong color.a week later got 3 more.these are falling apart and there different from all the other dresses.two days on the phone with amazon they didn't care they was rude.they said to contact China and deal with them and you will have to send them $50 restocking fee.we have a wedding that they're trying to ruin. We threw those dresses in the garbage along with $600 dollars. ..look don't deal with these people.when they mess up your order your screwed. They just want your money.there not or don't know how to run a business. When you order a product they get it from chins for nothing.search directly try searching overseas products.
"submitted 2 orders this month. have to go thru hell for them to get it right. shows del date on original order and confirmation shows another date, so send email and they give u another date.  finally arrived.  what a bunch of idiotssubmitted order today. final order indicated all items prime. get confirmation and not so.  one item is another seller will take up to a month to deliver and already posted charge on my card.  they use some unethical sellers.  I wanted to cancel order and told only 1/2 hr after submitting.  so I ask how to cancel and still waiting for an answerdecided to cancel entire order.  they refused.  it wasn't shipped yet, but going to be , so would not cancel all of the items.  they r rude and refuse to help u with questions.  I told them I would refuse all deliveries as they would not discuss returns with me.  I ask for confirmation and steps they would take when I refuse package.  still waiting for answer for which I will never get one.  their merchandise turns out to often be of very low quality.  shop dollar store. better merchandise.  I have prime and that is a rip off.  never use amazon.  find other ethical, trustworthy companies that u can b sure your money is taken without any merchandise."
They steal $99 from you when you sign up for the free trial.  Then you get someone called Vohor (Yes that is his name and he even spelled it for me and he would not give me an employee number after he would just ignore what i was saying) on the phone and he will not transfer you to a supervisor.  They will not refund the full amount they steal from you.  
"Amazon really annoyed the crap out of me. They removed feedback I left on one of their sellers named Mokingtop.  I needed an item quickly and placed my order.  Nowhere in the seller's name or product description did it state the seller was in China.  Delivery will take 1+ MONTHS! Amazon removed my review because I indicated Amazon should clearly show seller locations and is equally at fault. Bad publicity=controlled review listings.  This is wrong, shame on this retail giant. They'll probably try to remove this review, Ha! Thanks ResellerRatings!"
"Just had a bad service for Amazon.  I tryed to return a package that was not the quality/or item that was described. From the time I purchased this item until today, my debit card that was charged for this item was stolen, well good ole Amazon has to return only to this debit card that is stolen. No other way to receive it. Per the customer service rep. who does not speak english.  Piece of shit."
"I've had several unpleasant, time-consuming experiences with Amazon lately.  They've had some bad press, what with hoodwinking many authors whose books they sell.  Then there's also a public radio piece about the top positive reviewers being paid in freebies by the manufacturers whose products they sell.  So my ""torment"" at the hands of Amazon, given Marketplace sellers who are rude about products that don't work being returned--and Amazon, itself, defaulting on its supposed guarantee--is apparently now par for the course.  I imagine, tho' it will take time, another retailer will emerge to replace a vendor, Amazon, that is past its ""prime,"" pardon the pun.  Their comeuppance is due, and will surely ""come.""  The sooner the better, as far as I am concerned."
"Amazon is becoming very conning specially with prime membership, they hide it within the shipping cost, and when you don't think about it and make a purchase, amazon automatically signs you up for Prime membership and a month later you are being charged $99. Just be carefully out there not to get screwed by Amazon. I personally about to stop purchasing from amazon due to safety reasons, and my losses with it."
"Prime is no longer worth jack. -Tons of items no longer ""prime,"" so I can't order what I want to without extra costs, extra uncertainty, and longer shipping.-Late shipping. Almost no ""prime shipping"" within 2 days-The Prime Pantry items is a joke. Another extra flat fee per order. So now basic items are ""exclusive"" so you have to be prime to order, but then you pay more on top of paying more since the mark-ups for products like Method foaming hand wash refill is twice as much, dishwasher detergent pods are around $7 more for what I was looking for - compared to non-sale target prices.-Inconsistent releasing TV shows and poor Prime movie selection-Don't vet fake reviews well -- even if a product only has 20 reviews that read in the same smarmy marketing language always ending in the typed language ""I highly recommend this product.""-With the invoice order below, because of the entries stated above, I couldn't ordered the brand item I wanted, I couldn't order the item at all, and delivery of items reported for delivery as late as 4 full days.-Because so many stores offer free shipping my orders and more/better products like a good ironing board, cleaning products, candles, and pantry items have been diverted to Target.com and other places.-Amazon Prime is now on the losing end of the cost benefit analysis and partly because of loss of good will for all the items addressed above."
"be aware of who you buying the products from. 3rd party sellers are there to rip you off. bought a batteries for my wheelchair, the description mention that it will fit my wheelchair  not explaining the model of the wheelchairs. when it came it will not fit in my wheelchair, so as normal i went online to get a return label but find out i cant i have to pay for it, i spoke to amazon they told me 3rd party seller has their own rules and they cant help me. never thought amazon will fail me.so now will i go back to shop on amazon to look for product to see who is selling them. i don't thing so, Walmart has come long way and have been good to me, hope they dont scru up too"
"On Friday, April 17, 2015 before 8:00am, I placed 2 orders and paid additional money for next day delivery. Late Friday evening I received an email from Amazon that the items would be delivered at 8pm Saturday evening.  As luck would have it, the items did not arrive. I contacted Amazon's Customer Service department shortly after 8pm Saturday evening. I spoke with a first line representative, a supervisor and manager to explain that my shipments never arrived which were gifts for my niece's birthday party on Saturday.  I also explained that my niece waited all day to receive her gifts and was excited about her special day.  All 3 Amazon representatives told me that the delivery date and time were estimates, and that the items would arrive on Monday, April 20. Nowhere did it mention that the overnight shipping was an estimate.  The reason I asked for a manager is because the supervisor also said, ""sometimes we get disappointed."" This was unacceptable! I told her that adults understand, but children do not. Children are kids for a short time and look forward to birthdays and holidays. Had I known on Friday morning when I placed the order that delivery was going to be at 8pm not earlier in the day, I would have cancelled the order.  Such information was sent via email late Friday evening and should have been noted during the ordering process. A delivery time should be available when an order is placed.  Additionally, when the packages did not arrive by 8pm Saturday evening, I only learned by calling Amazon customer service that the packages would be delivered on Monday. Amazon did not take the initiative to notify me of the delayed deliveries. Had I known that the guaranteed delivery date which I paid additional shipping cost for had changed, I would have gone shopping either Friday or Saturday with my niece for her gifts. The Amazon representatives were insensitive to the situation and made excuses for the company. Their generous offer was to refund the guaranteed overnight shipping cost. Meanwhile, I still have no gifts for my niece. To say the least, I am extremely disappointed with my overall Amazon experience. "
"Have purchased multiple items from Amazon over the years, every time the service is middle of the road, they charge their sellers huge margins, and then the sellers cant provide service then they hammer them with warnings and emails after emails all support from Overseas who dont actually undestand the issue or problem they just sent out standard email responses and when you reach three or 4 warnings they fine you - they pay theri staff next to nothing and are really slave drivers. They should not be in business its customers like us that make companies like these exist and they then use their muscle to be unfair to sellers and their staff.We need to stop companies like these, awful service!"
"my advice is simple: don't sell on amazon, they will keep your money and will demoralize you with messages like: ''Transfer amount scheduled to initiate on Mar 9, 2015*  '' that should change next week to ''Transfer amount scheduled to initiate on Mar 16, 2015* ''......... I have the tendency to the skilled as thievesI want to tell you my story:I started like a buyer on amazon occasionally since 2013 but in 2014, I tried to sell on amazon.com, the first sale was in October 2014: a book, then 6 tablets but I haven't received my money (approxim 2100 dollars) and each time it finds an excuse, the worst that they suspend my account, I write a lot of emails to him but they did not respond.So, don't sell on amazon, try ebay, it is very good and the service is best for either the buyer or seller. I'm right now a seller right now and the name of my store is : My eBay  Member id: centreleccanada_montreal  "
"I USE TO BRAG TO EVERYONE ABOUT AMAZON, HOW GOOD THEY WERE AS I HAVE BEEN A CUSTOMER FOR MANY YEARS, BUT THE LARGEST PURCHASE I MADE WAS ON A DIAMONG RING FOR OVER $15K AND THE RETURN POLICY WAS WITHIN 30 DAYS FOR ANY REASON, BUT I HAD A REASON, I HAD IT EVALUATED AND THE DIAMOND WAS CHIPPED, THE JEWLER IS IN TEXAS IS A SCUM BAG BY THE NAME OF ""CHANDNI JEWLERS"" ONE OF AMAZONS SCAM VENDORS! THEY REFUSED TO EVEN GIVE ME A RETURN AUTH EVEN THOUGH THYRE POLICY WAS ""30"" DAYS ANY REASON, NOW I HAVE RETURNED THE DIAMOND AND THEY HAVE HAD IT SINCE FEB 4TH YET AMAZON REFUSES TO GIVE ME BACK MY $15,500, 15 GRANS THEY ARE TRYING TO SCREW ME OUT OF, 15 BUIG ONES, I NOW HAVE TO SUE AMAZON TO TRY AND GET MY MONEY!"
May be good place for buyers but worse for sellers. Amazon customer team is totally focused on buyers and biased. Whole team is unmature for decision making.
"Sloppy seller guarantees. I lost a $600 camera because Amazon gave a scam artist a refund. The guy claimed he never received the camera; the postmaster personally confirmed it was delivered and received. You cannot chat with anyone, or call, only emails. Everyone you deal with is in India. I will not buy from Amazon, or sell. Stay away. "
"I recently tried to buy a NoNo hair remover as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. First, it never ever arrived. Instead of a full refund, I got robbed by Amazon.com $93.46!! They say they put that amount back on my card (it was a split payment--part on a gift card. part on my credit card), with ""documentation,"" and it never ever appeared on my credit card! I tried to dispute it with my credit card company and they just said that Amazon has ""documentation."" So Amazon.com, being the stealthy thieves that they are, just put me out by $93.46!!!--money, that I really need! Thanks a lot, Amazon!!!"
" review of Amazon, February 13, 2015 By doympls Verified Purchase(What's this?) This review is from: TYCO KENDALL 202020 Filac FasTemp Thermometer - FasTemp Probe Covers - 1 TB Amazon claims that the deceptive listing for the product that was listed Jan 14 2015 which now has been changed was no fault of the seller, therefore the fault for placing a deceptive listing along with an improper product description must lie with Amazon. Amazon is unwilling to admit their fault, and i am stuck for paying for something I purchased but did not receive. This review is not on the product as shown but only against Amazon. Amazon is trying to say that I received what I ordered which is not true, I did not receive what was depicted in the listing of Jan 14. the listing image has now been corrected but the product description still describes the thermometer and accessories, it should list that they are probe covers. The photo below is the original image of the product listed. I cannot post picture here"
"Amazon runs a shoddy business.  I was in the middle of ordering a gaming chair , I had it in my cart and the price went up 20 dollars. I contacted Amazon and they said sorry our prices are always changing . I said so you can change the price once it's in the cart and thyw said yes that is some bad business .  I will not shop at Amazon again "
"Purchased an item that was supposed to be new but they sent a refurbished model. Amazon was absolutely no help. They told me to pay for return shipping and then they could look into it. This seller lied about the product they were selling, should be an automatic expulsion from Amazon...I thought Ebay was bad."
"Do NOT purchase an Amazon Prime membership.  It is complete GARBAGE. . .totally worthless.  I received a membership to Amazon Prime (free) through a credit card promotion.  I first noticed that the movies, music, etc. offered for ""free"" via the membership were not anything that anyone would be interested in seeing/hearing/reading.I did decide to place an order through Amazon and use my Amazon Prime membership for the ""free"" 2-day shipping.  The order was placed on January 15, 2015 at 10:59 AM.  Amazon did not bother to ship the order until February 1 at 7:45 PM.  Of course, my order did not arrive as ""guaranteed"" on February 3.  I contacted Amazon and they were ""very sorry"" for the inconvenience.  DO NOT PAY FOR AN AMAZON PRIME membership as it is completely worthless.  And I will NEVER place another order with Amazon."
"Shoddy and unacceptable customer service.Amazon have put my account 'on hold' for absolutely no reason and refuse to unhold it.""We didn't receive your fax"", yes you did! I sent it to you five times! Awful customer service, the 'account specialist' cannot be reached by phone, only by 80's era fax machines, appalling service, they just do not care at all. No other website I have used has this appalling and unintuitive 'verification method'. Shoddy website. Accounts can be put 'on hold' for no reason at all and Amazon will then keep all of your gift card balance and any other balances all for themselves."
"I tried to cancel my Amazon Prime membership a few weeks ago due to a price increase that I did not agree with. I first cancelled online and assumed I would not be charged for another year. A few days later my credit card was charged without my permission. So I called customer service this time to figure out what happened, and to get a refund. They did not give a good reason as to why it happened, but they were happy to issue the refund. I gave Amazon the benefit of the doubt and didn't think twice about it. A few days later my credit card was charged AGAIN. Now I'm raising an eyebrow and wondering what the heck is going on. I called to get a refund and they gladly gave the money back, but again did not have a good reason as to why my card was charged. Now in my head I'm thinking: ""wow they really screwed up, but there's no way it will happen again"". Well...not a few hours later my card was charged a third time without permission. I was getting quite agitated at this point and immediately called them to get a refund. This time I demanded an answer as to what was going on and warned them this better not happen again. They told me that the last two representatives that handled the issue before did not process the order correctly (pretty lame excuse). At this point I'm seriously considering cutting Amazon off completely. I can't have some company randomly charging my credit card without permission. However, I have used Amazon for many years and enjoyed the service, so again I assumed they would correct the situation and we would get past this. To my great dismay, my credit card was charged again today. I called again, and this time demanded that all my information be deleted from their website. I told them that I would not have anything to do with Amazon in the future. In my eyes this goes beyond a couple mistakes, it is theft. Im writing this review to warn people that there is either something deliberately going on at Amazon, or their customer service agents are extremely incompetent. "
Amazon is the worst place to sell stuff. I sold some stupid lady a book and over a month and a half after she had used it for her class she asked me for a return. I said no but good ol amazon said sure you can have your money back. They forced me to pay her $150 even though she was a month past the return policy date. All they told me when I contact the was sorry she must have place the return before the return date. That was a lie because it shows when she requested a return. Screw Amazon!!!! I will never shop or sell with them liberal stupid SOBs!!! I hope they go out of business or get hacked. I hope one day I run into one of the amazon people who settled my return case!  
"amazon robbing customers! I am disgusted both at Amazon and at seller. My money was stolen, my book  time riders) was never delivered, I told amazon and they completely ignored me. What a disgraceful site, further to this they block all my reviews so they would avoid negative remarks"
i have seen in chenai the customer and delievery service was really worst .i suffered alot they deduct amount for fast delievery to delievery within 2 days but they not yet delievered i called to courier guy and chennai customer care they kept their mobiles in switch off mode i never suggest to my friends.
If you are not a Prime Member you are tossed to the side. Usually gets my packages at about 10 days from order and they almost always come beat to hell.
"Find another place to do business.  The customer ""service"" with this company has deteriorated to the point that, while we were considering selling product here, we will not sell product.  We cannot trust how this company will treat our clients.  Product sits for an average of NINE days before it ships, client support is not here in the US and there is no viable information to be garnered from anyone on the other end of the phone or email.  Do yourself a favor, buy local.  Amazon his HORRIFIC!"
"Beware of Galatics on amazon. I asked to cancel an order before they have shipped, they refused to cancel shipping, told me to refuse the item when it did ship,(which is still hasn't 2 days later)  and then are going to charge me $60 restocking fee anyways. Why would I pay a restocking fee for an item that hasn't left your warehouse yet?Seems they are forcing the item to ship so they can grab money for a restocking fee.This is no way to run a company. Not to mention I have a different person responding to my email every time."
Amazon offering false commitment   n changed after receipt of payment I think this is the platform where you will easily get cheated I order for computer item before processing of payment site is offering delivery with in 4 days but after payment with I  next 15 minutes terms cha ge to 6 day now site is show  deliver exp o  19th  I belive us company does not stand with his words
"For me, Amazon.com is the worst place where you can buy.The Customer Service is very bad, here an example:1st agent:07:41 AM PST Lateasha(Amazon): I will be emailing you another return label so that the item can be returned to us and once the item is received by us we will have the return shipping cost sent back to you. As I didn´t receive the new label, I contacted again with Amazon:2nd agent:01:40 PM PST Glenn(Amazon): The form was submitted successfully.I've forwarded our information to the Specialty investigation team trained to handle this issue. You should hear back from them in the next 1-2 business days. Please make sure to keep track of the emails they will send you should they ask further details only you can provide.As I didn´t receive any email from Amazon, today, 3 days after, I contact again with Amazon, and then, the 3rd agent has other different version:Amazon:I apologize, the agent should have mentioned you cannot return the item anymore This is my experience with the Amazon Customer Service.In this moment, I am in the same point in the beginning."
"Horrible service.  Placed an order and a week later, my item hadn't even been packed for shipment.  Canceled and purchased from a competitor.  Had the product in my hand 3 days later.  Nothing but excuses from the unresponsive ""customer service""."
Terrible! My boyfriend bought me makeup from my wishlist as a surprise for christmas he unknowingly clicked prime free 2 day shipping and it charged his card $100 (which the shipping took way more than 2 days to receive btw if you decide you do want gay prime). So I called them and told them it was my boyfriends card but my account and  explained the situation and they flagged my boyfriend for fraud. So his bank froze his acccounts and canceled his cards. Wtf. Something that went from a sweet surprise turned into a nightmare. You SUCK amazon. 
"A Merry Christmas turned into a sad Christmas! I ordered a watch for my husband as a Christmas gift, paid shipping charges so it arrives 12/23.  Lo and behold, the package didn't arrived. When I reported to Customer service, package was lost.  Just received replacement item but too late now. Christmas tradition just got ruined. Thanks Amazon:((("

Shipping and delivery time of items purchased from Amazon.com gets worse and worse. Packages arrive late and the tracking information provided on the Amazon site is inaccurate.  
"I ordered a phone and chose one day delivery with a guaranteed delivery date of December 24, 2014 and after checkout is complete I get a delivery date of December 26, 2014 (WTH). This is a review about amazon customer rep. They are now just like other retarded reps that are outsourced and do not speak or understand English. They make up stories and lies about why a shipment is late and why even though I upgraded to one day shipping my delivery date is different from what was stated. It feels like i'm talking to a brick wall (i'm looking at you Rohit) and that is an insult to walls everywhere. "
"Christmas is ruined thanks to Amazon and their seller, Sonic Copters. Ordered a drone for $400, product arrived 10 days later, damaged. Called Amazon. Amazon instructed me to call seller. Called seller. Seller said they would refund me once they receive the item back. They said that would be in about 10 days. I said I needed the money much sooner that that so I could buy a replacement product. They said there was nothing they could do and suggested I take it up with Amazon. I called Amazon. I was so impressed with them as an ethical company when they told me to go ahead and overnight the product back to the seller, and call them to let them know the amount I paid for shipping and they would reimburse me. I went to FedEx and packaged the item up and got rang up by the clerk. She informed me that the total would be $206. I told her I'd better call Amazon before I pay $206 out of my own pocket. I called Amazon, and after 1 1/2 hour on the phone and three different representatives, I was told they were sorry that I was misinformed and there was no way they could pay that amount for shipping, nor was there any way they could issue me an advanced refund for the product. I would have to wait 48 hours (that would be until Christmas Eve) for a manager to call me to discuss a resolution. The end of the story is that there will be no resolution because I needed that money for Christmas and I had no chance getting it back by then because Amazon is not an ehhical enough company to stand by their word. I even have an email saying that I would be refunded for the shipping, but nobody there seemed to be concerned about that. Maybe they should have been..."
I'm a long term Amazon Prime customer who typically buys well over $5000 a year. I am disgusted with Amazon's lack of accountability and intentional hiding of meaningful ways to provide feedback on Amazon's performance. I had a recent review denied because it was negative to Amazon who fulfilled the order but not the supplier. They are way to isolated from the consumers.
"I ordered a ceramic Christmas ornament and Amazon shipped it in a padded envelope.  The ornament arrived in multiple pieces.  While Amazon refunded my money, they were completely indifferent to the fact that absolutely no care or thought was given to how to package the ornament.To them, the refund cost was an acceptable cost of doing sloppy business.  They just no longer about their customers."
I have NEVER been so dissatisfied with a company.  WORST Customer Service EVER!!  Obvious errors on their end with my account and cancelled my shipments in the middle of my order without notification.  And then said I cancelled it....no cares to try and rectify the situation either....AWFUL!!
Never got my product.  Very disappointed.  I've ordered a lot of things from amazon. And of course around Christmas time they mess up shipping my package. Will never order from amazon again. 
"Amazon pretends to post user reviews, but, in fact, the reviews are carefully culled, no matter how negatively the user is mistreated by the merchant.  If you see a merchant with a pure five star rating, most likely they are horrible and Amazon is cleaning up a shoddy merchant's reviews.There is no reason to pay the premium Amazon charges, your odds of getting a satisfactory transaction are better just going to some random web site."
I ordered a projector for my son's birthday with a GUARANTEED 2nd day UPS air.. the day it was GUARANTEED to be here it was not.. I was lied to by amazon and UPS.. amazon has lost a family of amazon shoppers.. They ruined my son's birthday
"After reading other reviews here, the consensuses is Amazon is no longer what it used to be.  I now have to pay CA tax, yet shipping might as well come from China.  I was informed if you opt for 'free shipping', you will be put on indefinite hold while they service paid shipping customers.  They use the same shipper in either case, its the time it takes them to package that makes the difference.  Its been nearly two weeks since I ordered and it has yet to leave their warehouse.  Anyone wanting a Xmas present before the 25th, should look elsewhere unless they order before Thanksgiving.  To get normal delivery service, Amazon customers are now forced to pay high shipping fees (which really means faster packaging).  So the values of the past with Amazon, are no more.  Look elsewhere for cheaper prices and better customer service."
"I used to be in love with Amazon and prime shipping. But here lately they have been worthless and costing ME money! I make candles and soaps for gifts, and with it being the holiday season, receiving the products that I not only pay a prime membership for but pay to have one day shipping on top of that, I expect to have my products on time so I can continue my business just as Amazon does with theirs. This week alone I have TWO orders that they have screwed up and I still don't have in my possession. I have to pay up front to get my items but they did nothing to contact me to inform me that my items are lost in transit! LOST! So thanks Amazon and the person with the Indian name I can't pronounce for not helping me at all with this issue. Whoopty doo! I got my money back for the products but what about the $500 in gifts that were ordered through me that I can no longer complete on time because of Amazon?? Will they reimburse me for that OR explain to my customers that they lost my products? Most likely not! I will be going back to eBay, know why? Because they are now doing it right, I don't have to pay for my items until AFTER i receive them! Take note Amazon. I'm done with you! I hope many more follow until they get their shit together!"
"I Nov. 24th I ordered a tablet from Amazon and paid extra for 2-day shipping. It's now 11/28 and it appears the package was lost on 11/25. Amazon has made no attempt to contact me, refund my shipping or do anything to correct the situation. The same tablet is now available at Best Buy for almost the same price and I'm stuck waiting for them to send me a new one. "
"I purchased a pair of Alpine speakers online. I received them in August and due to my schedule, I wasn't able to install them until November. Upon installation, I noticed one speaker was defective. I contacted Amazon only to learn they were not willing to do ANYTHING to help resolve this. I was told that it was past 60 days and I had to contact Alpine. I asked Eric L is Amazon was an authorized reseller for Alpine and was assured there will be ""No problem"" getting Alpine to replace the bad speakers. ""They are great with customers of Amazon"". I called Alpine only to learn Amazon is NOT an authorized reseller and Alpine will not honor ANY warranty since I bought them from Amazon. I called Amazon back and told them what Alpine said and asked if there was anything they can do. They said they would give me a ""Partial credit"". When I was able to pin them down on what ""partial"" meant, I was told $20. 3 month old $140 speakers that were defective from the start and I should be honored they will give me a $20 credit. Shipping back the speakers cost almost that much. I will NEVER purchase from them again."
"Amazon is as sleezy as yelp. I had to contact them SIX TIMES about an unauthorized charge! Each time, I had to tell my story over and over!! HOW ANNOYING!As if that's not bad enough, all of the hardly-English speakers ask you to repeat EVERYTHING! ""Sorry, what was that? Sorry could you repeat that? Sorry  I didnt get that"" They are the least empathetic.Then comes the worst part....They said that my inquiry will be escalated to a supervisor, that supervisor said it will be passed on to another supervisor, and that they will get back to me within 2-3 business days. It's been a week and I am on hold yet again with them AS I WRITE THIS REVIEW!! Horrible horrible customer service!! I have been on hold for a grand total of approximately 2.5 hours in all the phone calls i made to amazon customer service! "
product's order made through amazon are always late in its delivery. Where as in other competitive sites they delivered soon. I think this is one of the drawbacks of amazon
"Amazon's customer service is terrible.  I've received the wrong book, then shipped it back to them, only to receive the exact same wrong book again.  This time I put the UPS shipping label on it and set it out on the front porch for UPS to pick up, and it still sits there.  No way to contact Amazon about that, so I guess the package will sit at the door until someone steals it.  Not happy.  Very hard to talk to a person and one with authority to actually fix something."
"Do not buy jewelry from amazon. It is by far the worst dept. at amazon. I ordered a necklace, paid over $800 and never received it. Customer service stated that tracking shows that it was delivered and it is my problem to find out what happened. It should have been sent ins with signature required, but, according to customer service it was not."
"Amazon has the worst service ever compared to all other websites. I had ordered a camera on 13th Oct, estimated delivery date was 27th Oct (which itself is late)I dont receive the package even on 29th. Nobody from customercare dept also responds properly.I regret to have chosen  amazon. This was my first order...utterly disappointed"
"Amazon USED to be such an amazing company, now their customer service is TERRIBLE.  Imagine I order a large bird cage to be delivered to my freight forwarders in Florida.  The cage comes in 2 boxes but only one is delivered by Amazon.  When I get the half of the cage months later in Trinidad, I let them know I only got half the cage.  Mind you, Amazon NEVER contacted me to let me know there was a problem with the second delivery!  Now they said they can either give me a half a refund or send a new cage IF I RETURN THE HALF THE CAGE I RECEIVED!  I told them it is impractical for me to return the cage as it will cost more to ship it back than to make a new cage!  To me the only solution is for them to actually complete the shipment or refund me in full as they have not honored their contract.."
"I have bought a few cds through Amazon. The ones I buy are a little harder to find hence why I didn't buy them here in Toronto. The prices very greatly but typically they retail at reasonable prices. That said the price by the time it lands at my door becomes insane. Why, you might ask? Shipping! On average the shipping on them, new or used with these guys is well over $20. I am certain that Amazon gets a big cut from the shippers but it is only a CD. They don't weigh much and they are small. The post office would be real cheap to get them around.  So here is the hilarious part. Amazon asks me to do this review. I pointed out that I got hosed on the shipping so they sent me back an email saying ""sorry, we can't post your review unless you reconsider what you are saying"" and it directs me to a list of guidelines. In the guidelines it states "" if you have a comment regarding shipping please direct that to our complaints department and don't try to post that in your review"".  Lol. The shipping made this CD; one of the top releases in 1984 and a billboard top 100 seller one of the most expensive cds I have ever bought! I am an avid music buyer and have imported cds from all over the world. This is more expensive than most of those? Amazon's reaction: ""shhh!  Don't tell them that."" Is that a shock? Nope but the gag request is hilarious. "
"Been a customer for over 10 years. I ordered something on a Sat. that I needed before the following weekend. Checked to see if it was shipped on Mon, it wasn't, then I checked on Tues, it wasn't. I went to cancel and was told I couldn't. What!! I was told it was shipped, and questioned if it was, where's the shipping confirmation and tracking information. They said it's in the process of being shipped, I said I don;t want it because it won't get to me on time for a wedding (it's a monopod). They said they couldn't cancel, but I will be charged for it, I can refuse delivery, and I will be refunded. I said that's unacceptable and I cancelled my Amazon account because of total lack of customer service. "
"They wasted my entire day off when I arranged to have a package delivered today then laughed at me on the phone after telling me they ""misplaced"" it. I will make sure sellers don't use Ontrac before purchasing from them. Hours and Hours of my time wasted not to mention phone time with Amazon to get a refund. Now I'm told it will take days to get a refund before I can purchase from a different seller. I found a seller other than Amazon and at a cheaper price who doesn't use Ontrac. I had no idea buying from Amazon could be this bad. They kept me waiting with their cut and past responses for hours today. Just awful."
"Horrible customer service. If you contact them, they just paste prewritten answers into the chat window. They could not care less about your problem. I contacted them a dozen times with zero resolution."

We want you to know that we are still here for you and if you should have any troubles at all, please give us a call. The person I spoke to was Jeff in Technical Services.

Atwood's phone number is 574-264-2131. You will probably need to have the serial number available when you call in and a copy of your receipt as proof of purchase.

Now that I can see what damage the Cooktop has, I would like to run another option by you. Of course as we discussed I can still file the damage claim with UPS and they will come by to pick the unit up and return it to us and then we can send you a replacement out. This is not a problem to do but sometimes takes a little longer than the second option we have. From past experience we do not believe this damage happened in transit. If you would like I can reach out to Atwood and ask them to ship you a replacement top (only) under warranty. We are pretty confident they will do this since we have pictures of the damage and this has happened in the past. The damage appears to have come from manufacturing. This option will probably be a little quicker for you. Please let me know what you would like to do.

"Worst customer service ever, I spoke to a supervisor as well named Nick R and the rep prior to him was just horrid. They messed up delivery dates and an order that I needed to get. I know amazon is normally fine on auto pilot but if you ever need help their outsourced customer service is really bad. You are much better off maybe spending a little more money for good service. "

"Bad So Bad!....Product Quality is bad. Most item i bought used from this website usually dies within a couple of months. So dont buy used. Only buy New. Plus the used items dont come with any warranty so u cant rma your item. Theres also no used warranty option anywhere. So buy at your own risk. Their customer support usually get the job done but it takes a while. They take a while to respond back (online chat). Shipping is worst. It takes almost a week. 2 days for packaging, and the other 5-7 days for UPS Sure-post (USPS). "
"Amazon's new pay-by-check feature?  Don't bother.  May save them money, but it costs you in grief.  These very stupid people pass the check to Telecheck.  If Telecheck isn't up to date, you're screwed, your check bounces, your credit history is annotated and so on.  Jeff ain't minding the store, and it shows in this ill-considered process."
"I ordered a pair of running shoes at $49.00 in late June for a 4th of July run. No problem--I'm a Prime member, I know this shoe, and Amazon is great at fulfillment so I didn't even consider going to the local shop. I got confirmation of the purchase, and then, four days later, wondering why this order never arrived, I got a cancelled notice from Amazon claiming the product was out of stock. This note came complete with a link to prove the product was out of stock. Clicking the link showed that it was indeed in stock, but now priced at $113.00. Great. So I called them, wasting more of my time, and all trust that I had built up with Amazon over the year completely eroded in a matter of minutes. The person I spoke with just reiterated that it was out of stock and there was nothing that could be done about it, despite the fact that it was indeed in stock with links proving that fact. I asked to speak to a manager, who, after an infuriating exchange of utter nonsense, told me he couldn't help and would hang up on me; which he did. Flabbergasted, I called back, spoke to another customer service person, who finally spoke the truth, that being: ""We messed up, and the link showing it is in stock is fulfilled by another supplier, and we cannot offer that price."" In his defense, he was civil, apologetic, human.Given this experience, I would advise you to not count on Amazon to fulfill orders of any product that is needed on a specific date at a specific price.Given the options, I believe that zappos.com and 6pm.com are both far superior in shoe sales, fulfillment and customer service, as are local shops.Happy Trails!"
"Don't get decieved by their prices ,most of their sellers are not authorized.you can buy cheap stuff from amazon but don't ever buy electronics or expensive stuff!!they won't refund you or replace your damged product.I bought  a $500 product (silk'n xl)that supposed to have a 65,000 pulse that would be more than enough for me and my spouse for life and it just broke down in the 3rd or 4th use!!! And the company refused to replace it because the seller is not an authorized seller ,and amazon as well refused to do anything about it though i trusted them not the seller!!! "
"Amazon is getting worse and worse every day.The package arrived torn up, without any padding.The customer service is always incognito , no real person to talk to.The return has been refused and the representative was rude and unskilled.  When I started complaining about it - they just canceled my account.Not buying from Amazon anymore"
SUCKS! People think they have the lowest price so they dont check anywhere else. I just did some research and found almost everything I was buying from them at lower price in other online stores. They seem to have outsourced their customer India. I can't get a reasonable answer from anyone over their. I'm done with amazon
"Amazon sold me a defective item and then refused to process my return. They closed my account without any explanation (unless you can accept that for a valid reason):------quote: ""We have found your account is directly related to another account which has been closed for abuse of our policies. As such, your Amazon.com account has been closed.""--------I have tried to contact them and receive some explanation and access to my order history, my invoices, and scheduled deliveries but received only vague semi-automated responses written by some foreign customer service reps. Amazon operations seems to be outsourced to some third world country, that would explained rude and vindictive attitude of the CSRs and lack of understanding of customers rights that are in place in the US. No, I did not make any excessive returns--ironically, in Amazons (red) eyes I tried to buy too many items from Amazon.com--they cancelled my orders and then closed my account for placing too many orders... I am not sure who writes their policies but surely they come from policy makers in one of the commie countries.You have been warned--if you buy from Amazon.com you are buying from a bussines supervised and operated from a third world country--stay away or one day you will receive the following email: --------quote:""Hello, As your account is closed, we will not be accepting any returns from your account. You can review our Conditions of Use here: www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse Thanks for your understanding.Best regards,Account SpecialistThank you.Amazon.com""---------"
"I placed an order for a double vanity sink from Amazon.  For several days, I received updates on the order then the updates were less frequent.  Amazon pushed out the delivery date a couple of times and after two weeks, I cancelled the order realizing I was never going to receive the vanity.  I wrote a negative review on their website (without profanity) just stating the facts (as shown above) and Amazon came back stating that they would not post the review.  That is hilarious because as a seller on Amazon, they do not mind lowering your rating if you (the seller) continually push out the delivery dates on a customer's item.  Never shopping Amazon again."
Amazon middlemans everything and owns nothing.Do a little searching and you will get the item cheaper supporting the original seller without supporting a skinhead ripoff artist.
"I ordered using Prime one-day shipping and the nitwits used the USPS again.  For the third time, they used the USPS on a time sensitive item and, as precision is hardly their thing, the USPS missed the mark.  It was for a child's birthday this time.  Why can't a customer select the carrier and level of service at our own cost?  They make good on the finances, but a 9 year old boy hardly cares I got a refund.  They are just plain unreliable."
My first experience with Amazon was terrible.  Will not try to purchase from them ever again.  My advice - Steer Clear!
Amazon Order not shipped 4 days.No feedback or processing of order in 4 days.No way it could arrive by promised date.Cancelled and ordered from Ebay.Items were in stock and to be filled/shippedby Amazon not a 3rd party.Very diappointed in Amazon. Most past orders OK. Some very slow.Review rejected by Amazon will post to E-commerence review WEB sites.  Terrible customer service.
"Amazon is unethical, and so are their stores. I just ordered a 3 item $90 order, and there's no reasonable way to find out how much the shipping costs until you finalize the order. It turned out to be $30 for 3 lightweight items! I've had it with their profiteering on shipping. I do like them because they have just about everything under the sun, but their web page is not easy to use. But enough with the insulting low prices where they hammer you on the shipping cost. I know for sure it doesn't cost them $10 to ship a $4 item weighting 4 Oz from stateside. Buyer beware, and look elsewhere until they fix their shipping ripoff."
"I have both enjoyed and on other occasions have been cheated by ordering products through Amazon, without retribution. I ordered a Martha Stewart book on June 8, 2012, order #002-1886250-8973042for $19.99, and it was apparently delivered to my old address, although all account updates had been made with my new address BEFORE the order.Records show someone signed for it, yet all people living there now deny it arriving there, and it showed delivered on Amazons product status page regarding my order. The mailman was never available when id call or stopped in, Post office kept saying hes only available on Saturday mornings before 7 a.m. Of course, I was unavailable at this time and this info came at the end of my fruitless journey of trying to at least get a refund from Amazon, of trying to give a fair report of what happened on Amazon, of trying to get anything from amazon like an explanation, instead of the curt, ohwell-itsyourproblemnow, notmyfault; from the seller Avesta Ariana. Looking on that same order, there is only record I bought it, and no sign of the reports I made, or comments or bad ratings I reported. It looks as though I got it and was happy, which is a lie.Anyway, about a year later yet again on amazon,I prayed about it and ordered the same book from a different seller, and got it.I also ordered vaccuum bags last year from Amazon, hepa filter guaranteed. They were cheap imitations, and didnt come in the packaging shown on the site. Happily, I read reviews after ordering, and when it arrived to my house, I denied the order, and sent it back, called our bank and rejected the charges. I did get a full credit.But I would bet if I had not been savvy enough to read the reviews, and accepted the package, would have been the same old martha stewart $19.99 story. Amazon has never had a person come back and help me, when I really needed the help after being scammed. They pretty much let the buyer go,nyahh nahhhhhh. I also got several kindle books, which were never delivered to the right device, but they show I didnt complain, though I did. Other transactions have been pleasant."
"I dont know where to start with Amazon. I liked Amazon, I shop and sell on Amazon. At least I thought it is better than Ebay. But I was wrong. Ebay customer service is way better. Someone ordered from me almost 3.5 months ago. I sent the item to him and provided him with all tracking info. Just couple days ago, he sent me a message saying that he did not receive it. If he called me a week after the item was sent, I would totally refund him, but 3.5 months later, I think this is a scam. I called Amazon and they tricked me into filing an A to Z form for the buyer when it should have been the buyer who file for it. They immediately took the money out of my account and refunded him. They even said that the guy contacted me before but I did not reply. Are you kidding me? All messages sent to me are through Amazon and recorded by Amazon in the system, I check it and the first email I got from this guy was 3.5 months after the order date. Oh wait did I mentioned that the buyer can only file for this form within 90 days. I also helped him all I can and even called Amazon. I tried to appeal but they disregard my opinion totally. I called Customer Service and they played dumb with me. This is the was customer service I have ever received in my entire life. The A to Z department did not give me an answer of why they refunded back the money without any proper reasons. Do they even know about their own policies or follow their own policies?"
Been buying at Amazon for a few years now. But I ordered 4 things from there just 10 days ago. And they got 2 wrong. 1 was real wrong they sent a 50.00 camera part for a 7.00 cup. I let them know and sent it back. They then sent the right thing. But the rest of the order came and again the order was wrong. They sent the wrong travel cup.I let them know and sent that back. They then sent me the same wrong cup again.By now even though they don't give you your money back I just want my money back and tell them so. I right a review on the cup and company that sent it out--knowing that it was really them who sent it out.They refuse to publish it.I reword it not calling them idiots this time just stating the facts. They again refuse to publish this review. I notice that everytime someone even gives a honest review that is not good about a product they sell someone always comes in and says awe sorry that happened with the product but it was really just a fluke this is a good product and I have had it a year now and had no problems at all. Well bull do do. What else are these reviews for? Does Amazon pay people to go in and rebut anything anyone says negative about something that they sell? One would wonder after reading some of the negative reviews and the follow up from supposed customers. Just saying.  
"On 1/1 I placed an order for items I needed to complete a project on 1/4.  Because I needed the items by that date, I paid $21.97 (a reasonable price) for ""One-Day Shipping"".Amazon shipped the item via UPS Ground service. Of course it didn't arrive on time (Amazon claimed delivery by 1/3, but item hasn't yet been delivered and it's 1/4.  Since UPS doesn't deliver on Saturday, I won't receive it until AT LEAST 1/6), so my project won't be completed on time and I'll have to take a day off from work to complete it THREE DAYS LATER!The cost of UPS Ground shipping from the origin to the destination is around $12.00.  I was overcharged nearly $10 for ""One-Day Shipping"" that was actually ground shipping; and now I have to lose pay to complete my project.A word to the wise - don't EVER pay Amazon for expedited shipping.  And don't EVER purchase an item from Amazon that you absolutely need to have in-hand by a specific date.  You'll receive neither."
"I am very disappointed in Amazon.  I placed an order for eight items for almost $200 on Sunday and as of today, Thursday, none of the items has shipped.  Yes, I understand I selected free shipping so I did not expect the fastest means of shipment but the least they could do is to get it out the door and to the carrier in a timely manner.  This is no longer the holiday gift giving season so I do not think they can blame the delay on workload.  This to me indicates the delay is only the result of an arbitrary punitive decision to make those who select free shipping wait so their other forms of paid shipping are attractive options.To make matters worse, when I emailed them about the problem I only received what was obviously a canned response because it was not even remotely related to the problem.  Who ever responded did not even read the email.Going forward I cannot say I will never use Amazon again but they will certainly be my last choice even if it is a little more expensive elsewhere.  Small Ebay vendors for instance often offer free shipping, and even though the actual shipping methods they use are not the fastest, most of them try very hard to ship the order within 24 hours. "
"It's not the same company it used to be.  It's a massive giant with no way to speak to anyone with authority if there is a problem.  All I get is 'form' emails from people from India - obviously their customer service has now been outsourced (nothing against India, but there is a language communication problem).  Some of their policies make absolutely no sense and it's like banging your head against the wall to get someone who can think listen to you.  I am so done with Amazon.  I'm going to be trying to place all my orders with smaller US based businesses going forward.  I know Amazon is a US based business, but they are now such a monstrosity I can't give them my business any more."
Deceptive shipping practices and policies. Inadequate packaging. quick on the trigger to make excuses but not solve problems.Amazon used to be OK but they are barely better than eBay. There are alternative companies that will at least give you the illusion that they appreciate your business.
"Amazon usually has great prices, that's way I've been using them.  I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to guarantee 2- day shipping. They claim to be Customer-Centric and that customer service is their priority.  WELL NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. I have consistently been having terrible issues with receiving item on time, quality of item (from Amazon and third party resellers that Amazon says they guarantee and stand behind)  Customer service is rarely able to get any matter resolved, if you ask for a supervisor, I'd say 40 % of the time you'll be told a supervisor isn't working.  (WHAT CALL CENTER/CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER IS EVER OPEN WITHOUT A SUPERVISOR ON DUTY!!!)unfortunately it's been my experience, many times, that Amazon offers some of the poorest customer service on the planet, not the best. "
"I got a defective (Cablecard tuner) part on the mail and proceed to spend several days trying to make it work. I went trough a pair of cable cards, cables, cable outlets, calls to Comecast and the Manufacturer and  finally gave up and decided to return it. I thought that was the end of my problem, but how wrong I was.I get a return authorization from the seller. I shipped the part back on 2 day shipping, the tracking shows delivered, but now the seller says that they didn't receive anything and that they are going to check with their post office. More than a week passes by and I haven't heard anything, so I sent a follow up email. I get nothing for 2 days so I create a claim with Amazon. Shortly after I get a message from the Seller saying that they never received the package (probably didn't even make an effort with their Post Office). I wasted more time with USPS, and all I get is that the package was delivered as the tracking number shows.I try to talk to Amazon to see my options and they tell me I need to produce a proof of delivery and that the tracking number isn't valid for that, even when I sent them the email from USPS saying that the recipient need to talk to their Post Office. To top it off they tell me that I need to respond in 3 days or they will close my claim. At this point I kissed my money good bye for I have a claim opened with USPS for almost a week and haven't heard anything. I have learned a few valuable lessons here and I hope the reader can make their own conclusion about the seller and learn from my experience. For all I know, the Seller may be walking to the bank, laughing, to collect my money and holding the part in his/her left hand."
"Don't Shop Cyber monday, a Laptop i have been following for $379 for over a month is now $479... some deal Amazon..... thinking i won't be using them much and... much better deals on Walmart.com"
Terrible customer service.  I got locked out of my account and tried to get help.  I was sent an e-mail and told to reply from that e-mail to get assistance.  I did and it was from an automated e-mail that doesn't accept e-mail just sends e-mails out.  Told me to sign into my account and send customer service an e-mail for help.  I'm locked out...which is why I needed to contact them.  This was after spending 20 minutes on the phone with customer service.  Terrible company and terrible service.  I won't be buying anything else from Amazon.
"i bought a pair of memory and as a prime member i could have dont the free 2 day shipping (it takes longer because they use smartpost)but i wanted it overnight so i paid for overnight the shipping options dont say what service they use only ""if i want it next day "" its blah blah blah extra .. well next day came and went and it wasnt delivered so i knew they shipped it ground because friday is black friday u.p.s does not consider it a shipping day .,.  had they done  the honorable thing they would have indeed shipped it red or blue and at the very least would have had my package friday .. what it boils down is amazan has become a greedy cheap dishonest company overpromising and underdelivering .. shame on you amazon"
"The product, a support undergarment for vulvar varicose veins, appeared to have been used. It was dirty, and if I'm going to be asked to pay full-price for a NEW product, it better be new and clean.Amazon did absolutely nothing to resolve the situation. It was so bad I was scared to wear it and ended up getting one from a company I'd never heard of called Egan Medical (www.eganmedical.com). Now this new company's price was better, I received it on a Wednesday when I ordered it the previous Monday (2 days), and their customer service staff was easy to access and very helpful. I ended up not needing to exchange it, but they assured me it wouldn't have been a problem if I had.If anyone else is considering buying from Amazon, I'd recommend going ANYWHERE else first."
"This review is of the Amazon Gift Card only. I received a gift card and redeemed it into my amazon account.  After several failed attempts to use the $50 amount I contacted customer service. ""Paula"" advised me that I would not be able to make a transaction until I provided a new credit card number despite my account showing a credit of $50. She even asked me to borrow someone else's credit card number...what???.  In my opinion, this is very close to fraud."
"Amazon.com is TERRIBLE and does not cater to pleasing its customers whatsoever.I ordered a book over 1.5 weeks ago to prepare for a standardized test next month (mind you, they do not have to ship the book internationally or anything difficult) and it was supposed to have been delivered by now according to THEIR email. However, IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN SHIPPED YET. I called Amazon several days ago, and was informed that I should wait. I called them again today telling them I'd like to cancel my order and they said I could not cancel it EVEN THOUGH THE ITEM STILL HASN'T BEEN SHIPPED. Instead, I have to wait for the item to get here (whenever that happens), send it back to them, wait for them to receive the item, and then wait for them to refund me.TERRIBLE TERRIBLE experience. I will never purchase an item from Amazon ever again. Not worth the hassle and inconsidersation they show their customers.   "
"Don't ever shop at Amazon if you plan on returning any of the junk they send you.  They closed my account and all associated with my address or addresses my account has shipped to(including my parents house) saying that I have excessive returns.  Well Amazon, if you would stop sending defective items then I wouldn't have to return them and by the time they show up at the door and end up junk, its easier to just go to the store and pay a couple more dollars and end up with something that works than wait another 2 weeks to get a working item from Amazon.  One of my biggest returns was because the main item did not work and I returned the accessories for the item, I was told this was OK by the chat support but apparently this is frowned upon and will make you end up with a closed account.I have not received a refund for the part of an order that did not ship and they apparently have canceled my 2 pre-orders as well.I will do all further shopping elsewhere and point everyone I know in a different direction since you aren't allowed to return anything without be reprimanded for it.Doing a quick search on the internet shows that they do this to many people without a real cause except ""excessive returns"" and working out the issue is next to impossible since all communication has to be done through email and the phone/chat support can not assist at all.Good job Amazon, you lost more than one customer by closing my account for such a asinine reason."
"Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)This review is for: PetSafe Wireless Pet Containment System, PIF-300DO NOT BUY anything this expensive from Amazon as they will NOT stand behind these products!!!30 days is all Amazon gives as guarantee, which is not enough time to evaluate.So I lost ove 230 bucks!!!"
The last 2 items that I have bought from Amazon were defective.  That makes the total of defectives over 5 years at about 50%.  Amazon does not aid in any way when these broken or non-functional products issues need to be resolved.  Amazon.com should just stay in the book business. I completely agree with Timobviate's review below.
"They were good in the past, but lost it. Please especially do not make buying decision based on free shipping, because apparently waiting 2 weeks is the norm. When you inquire, expect a form letter response about efficiency.  "
"I recently purchased an item Sold by Amazon.com LLC on Thursday morning, and by Wednesday of the following week, it still have not shipped yet.  I called customer service to ask whats going on and they kept reading from a script that they are trying to find the best shipping method available and that due to the free shipping I picked I would just have to wait even after around 6 days just for it to leave the warehouse.  I can understand if this was a third party selling I would have to wait this long but for an in stock items Sold and Shipped by Amazon, this is just ridicules."
"RED FLAG, Dishonest, and Ripped Off!I ordered some books and paid in full almost $200 to Amazon, which did not ship my books and kept my money. I requested Amazon to reship or to refund my money. For over 1 month, Amazon refused to comply. I am a student and have no money to fund such a giant like Amazon keeping my money in its bank drawing interests. At the mean time, I have no books for school. This is my first order and my last order too because of Amazon's greed. dishonesty and its inferior customer service lead Dustin who refused to cooperate or to refund my money. I strongly NOT recommend Amazon.com to anyone!"
"I tried to cancel part of my order that hadn't shipped yet, since the order had only been made hours ago. I received a response email from Amazon stating ""We are unable to cancel your order ...... "". This is on a weekend, and only the first part of the order was being shipped, not the second part, which was the part I was trying to ship. My reason for canceling was one of the valid reasons offered, yet it was ignored. Amazon WILL NOT cancel any unshipped order, even if the reason is valid."
I have used amazon for many years and have never had an issue. I mainly use it to buy my college textbook and they have been wonderful. This time I had a gift card balance from selling back some books and when I went to buy some for the new semester I made sure that the gift card balance was being used towards the order and I know that when I checked out it said that I owed the left over balance. When I checked my credit card account it showed that they were charging me the FULL amount. And since the orders had already shipped by the time my credit card showed the pending transaction they couldn't do anything about it so now I have to send back some of the books and reorder them in order the get my money back. Now I will probably not have my books until two weeks into school. It is not my fault that their computer messed up and I plan on calling them everyday until they do something to fix this issue. 
"Consistently horribly slow shipping. I have no clue why amazon, the supposed number 1 online retailer, takes such excessive times to process orders (3+ business days). Most companies are able to ship in stock items within 24 hours. Even their customer service cannot tell you when it will ship, and delivery estimates vary greatly - mine ranged an entire week, for simple 1 in stock item orders."
"I am not sure who I dislike more, Amazon or FedEx, but this time I put most of the blame on Amazon for the 10 days it took to receive my order.   First they sit on it for two days then they ship it FedEx which takes 8 days and of those 8 days 4 of them are needed to cover the last 104 miles (according to Google maps) to reach me.  What a joke.  This is not my first Amazon order but it is well apt to result in my last if they continue to not process orders in a timely manner and continue to use FedEx.  I have never had much use for FedEx with any vendor.   Unlike UPS they generally cannot be bothered to deliver packages themselves but drop them in the mail for the last leg.  In most cases, including this one, I cannot really fault the USPS because most of the delay occurs when it is in transit with FedEx.."
Let Premium E Juice USA sell on your website again...Why did Amazon suspend PEj?...you let lizard Spit...i mean juice...So wrong Amazon...If you are going to let one sell you need to let all sell.They had a 5 star Rating
"Delivery date came and went, no shipment arrived, this is the usual treatment from amazon. Good luck and look elsewhere, only order here if you have to."
"I used to spend thousands on Amazon. I don't do it anymore. They used to ship the items out the same day. Now, it sit in ""processing"" for days. I have friends that said the same thing. I'm sure there are thousands or even millions out there that feel the same. They better get their act together. They are losing a lot of business like that."
"DO NOT PURCHASE ANY EXPENSIVE ITEMS FROM AMAZON!!! IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DSLR CAMERAS AND LENSES, BUY FROM B&H; OR ADORAMA. Here's my story, I loved Amazon. I haven't had any problems with them until I placed an order for my DSLR. Amazon shipped me the correct Canon box with a completely garbage item inside the box(Incorrect item inside the correct box). I contacted their customer service right after I found out that I got that incorrect item. I was afraid that they would blame me for that. At first, everything went smooth until they got the item back. They sent me an email saying that they got the incorrect item inside so they refused to send me refund. WTF!!! They are acting like as if it was my fault. I contacted them like 10 times via chat and phone calls. Finally, I chatted with a guy named Aman (leadership team member). That guy is totally BS. He said that I have to contact Amazon customer service, get a rep, and contact UPS in a conference to confirm that the package is delivered back to their return center. Think about it this way, if they haven't received my return package, then why the heck did I receive an email from them saying that they got the incorrect item inside the box. Totally BS AMAZON!!! Im so freaking pissed now."
"Amazon is using the 'Auto sign up' tool to trick customers into 'Amazon Prime' membership without notifying the member they have been subscribed and funds will be charged to your card, poor excuses and denial it was intentional by the auto respond robot, very irrating to be treated as an idiot  who doesn't monitor their account.Use Caution with Amazon !wish I could give 1/2 a star ratting ! Customer Service Stinks."
"I bought a Koblenz washer, for $174.48,on 9/5/12 and notified Amazon that return label was not included with shipment. I was asked to email the Investigation team with the pertinent information to see if policy was followed. I waited, emailed, emailed, emailed, emailed, emailed Amazon through the Amazon website and received ""I am so sorry to hear of your issues"" so many times that on 4/7/13 I finally noticed the telephone call option.  The most helpful CSR at Amazon, Mike scrolled through all the emails I sent to Amazon on the Koblenz washer and said he would call me on Friday April 12, 2013.  I received his call with Amazon's answer and thanked him for his assistance.  I have to pay fedex $176.28, for returning the washer within 30 days. "
not impressed with how my return was handled.
"Always order from Amazon (Prime Member) but they are slipping lately. Overnighted something for my daughter's birthday, it didn't arrive. It wasn't FedEx's fault, the item I overnighted, the only thing my daughter wanted, was not shipped by Amazon."
My complaint is about the seller review policy. Amazon only gives the costumer 90 days to write a seller review. This is a ridiculous policy. If a product gives problem I have to have to right to tell people how I was treated by the company. At anytime!
"Bought a new ""Actron CP7838 Professional Fuel Pressure Tester"" from Amazon itself, not from other seller, on 2/8/2013. When I received it, the internal package was already cut open, the tester was full of gas smell and the manual was missing. I'm so disappointed at Amazon. What a shame!"
"I had ordered a book for school, it was supposed  to be supplied through a sub.  The book never arrived and I'm getting no where with Amazon or their vendor ""Got all the Goodies"".  From this point forward I'll deal with another retailer."
"I tried to upgrade my phone through amazonwireless.  The sale went through fine, but within two hours their ""review team"" cancelled the order.  I wasn't given any explanation for the cancellation and I was referred back to my service provider to make this upgrade. My service provider (sprint) confirmed that I was eligible for upgrade and that there was no problem that they could see with my account.  Amazon customer service refused to tell me what the problem was with the order or why they wouldn't process it.  Sprint had no idea why amazonwireless was not allowing the upgrade.  This was my first experience with Amazonwireless and the only reason I was going to purchase the phone through them to begin with was because they had the cheapest price on the phone I wanted. I will never do business with them again based on this experience.  "
"ok, real quick. the shipping time are horrible. 5 work days pass before item ships. i shouldn't have to pay for ""prime"" service.also they ban new retailers for no good reason whatsoever.i'm done with amazon.com"
"Amazon is fast and convenient, especially if you use Amazon Prime for two day shipping.  Prices are generally competitive, though you can often find a cheaper price if you look hard enough.  However, the huge inventory and convenience make Amazon the first place I look when comparing prices.  When everything goes well, Amazon is great.Unfortunately, Amazon customer service is horrible.  You might as well be dealing with nameless, faceless robots.  I received multiple correspondence from ""a customer service rep"" who was also quite rude.  Good luck reaching customer service through the phone or getting your message returned.  Also Amazon can arbitrarily terminate your Prime account without refund if it thinks your buying habits are abnornal--even without proof of misuse.  Finally, the return policy states Amazon is not responsible for items once they are turned over to the shipping company.  So if you order an item that arrives broken, according to Amazon's return policy, they have no obligation to replace or reimburse you for the item."
"Amazon.com closed my account for reason being that I return too many items.  I have received so many defective items from Amazon.com, including their account ""Warehouse Deals"" selling non-described item, I purchased a Bazooka subwoofer, in which the product description stated that the product was open box and was in like new condition; after I received the item, the item had Chinese written on it saying it was a factory refurbished item.  Upon calling Bazooka USA to verify the product, they told me that according to the serial number, the product was indeed refurbished and was shipped to Asia and should not be sold in USA.  We used to have a Amazon.com store card, which advertised to give us 6 month financing without fees or interests.  When Amazon.com closed our account, we were left with all $880 to be paid immediately otherwise we were faced with a 28% interest rate.  Amazon.com is dishonest and kept selling fake, and wrongfully advertised products and services, and the consumer had to deal with it because they are the biggest online retailer in the U.S. market.  Their business practice is against U.S. consumer laws.I receved another email yesterday saying ""Hello,This is in response to your recent phone contact inquiring.We've found your account is directly related to another account which has been previously closed for abuse of our policies. As such, your Amazon.com account has been closed and any open orders have been canceled.If you are a Kindle customer, you can continue to access Kindle content in the Manage Your Kindle section of your account (www.amazon.com/manageyourkindle).

Now Amazon.com closed our account agagin with rude and business practices different than their advertisement.  I wish someone or the government can expose how bad Amazon.com is comparing to what they interpreted to be.  I will seek media exposure such as TV news channels, newspaper, radio, etc.  Everyone should know what Amazon.com is doing and if they return products that are defective and follow Amazon.com's advertised return policy, they will just end up getting their account closed down by Amazon.com and being banned from ever purchasing with this dishonest online retailer."
"I recently made two purchases on Amazon: some 'new' Canon ink and an 18"" paper cutter.  Bottom line:  both of the items I received were wrong/ different items which had been substituted for the items I ordered.I sent the two substituted items to J. Bezos, the President and CEO.  His office did not respond at all.I used to buy from Amazon because 'you got what you paid for', and the company stood behind the products.  Not any more."
"Sum up:  I purchased something, and then didn't get what was clearly delineated in the title of the item purchased.  I called them, and they told me that of course it wasn't included.  How was I suppose to know.  Read the small print?????  WTF!!!!!Details:  I rented a book which included in the title an access code.  Guess what, rentals don't include access codes."
9 times out of 10 my orders with amazon are perfect.  That other 1 is the pickle.  Outsourced customer service equals no customer service to me!
"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Do you know why Amazon.com currently does NOT actively participate at ResellerRatings to monitor feedback and resolve your issues? That would be because they could care less about the few people here or there that have GENUINE issues with there services. I Purchased 3 items on Jan. 8, 2013 for my son with a gift card that he got from his grandpa for Christmas. Long story short, Amazon charged my checking account for the ENTIRE purchase after I KNOW I ordered it correctly. I literally spent over 4 1/2 hours on several different phone calls with several different people who I could not understand and, at times, they could not understand what I was trying to relay to them!!! OUTSOURCED CUSTOMER SERVICE TO INDIA!!! Anyway, they cannot do anything about the $50 they stole from me and now I am stuck with $50 credit at Amazon that I don't need or want. Great! So let this be a warning to you if you are considering using Amazon..... "
"So much for prime membership and 2 day shipping. Paid for product early Dec 19 and they sat on it for 2 days before handing it over to UPS. So instead of getting my package on Fri Dec 21, it is now tentatively scheduled for Dec 24. The problem is I am leaving the country on Dec 23. Called them to see if they would upgrade the shipping to next day air but they refused. My advice - don't rely on their Prime shipping and give yourself plenty of time for delivery. Will not purchase from them again unless it's a deal too great to pass up."
"I do not recommend Amazon to anyone either seller or buyer.  I have only sold 2 items on Amazon, because the 2 people didn't submit feedback they have put my account under review and frozen all funds. With funds I mean over a thousand dollars for the 2 products that i sold.  This process has taken over a month and still will not return my emails and there is no way to contact the people that are reviewing the account by phone.  The customers have recieved there product ontime and exactly how it was described to them but even after several calls into  customer service they have just given me the runaround.  If you want to sell items online I would go else were before this happens to you."
"placed an order on 11/13/2012, 9 days later the price dropped by $40, when I contacted the vendor they refused to refund the difference. They stated that I could unwrap all the presents, repackage it and return it to them for credit in 2-3 weeks, then I could turn around and repurchase it again at the lower price, minus the shipping to return it of course. I contacted Amazon and they stated that it is a 3rd party vendor and they have no control over their pricing policy. I pointed out that I visited Amazon.com, not Cameta Camera.com to purchase this, based on what I thought was good customer service, but the didn't care. The reply I got was, sorry, nothing we can do. When these vendors sign up to sell on Amazon, surely Amazon can dictate a coherent and consistent policy regarding returns and price guarantees so that the entire website is the same. As I said it is Amazon's name on the website that I bought from. I'll NEVER purchase from them again. "
"A bunch of Blow Hards.First :BAIT- and - SWITCH:""In denoting a deceptive method of selling, by which customers, attracted to a store by sale items, are told either that the advertised bargain item is out of stock or is inferior to a higher-priced item that is available. """"A deceptive commercial practice in which customers are induced to visit a store by an advertised sale item and then are told that it is out of stock or that it is far inferior to some more expensive item. For example, I won't buy a car from this outfit; they're notorious for their bait and switch tactics . The verb to bait has meant to supply a hook or trap with a morsel of food so as to attract a fish or animal since about 1300; the verb to switch has meant to change, alter, or transfer from one thing to another since the 1890s. The pairing of the two, however, dates only from the 1920s, although the practice is surely much older. It is called switch-selling in Britain.""The American Heritage® Dictionary::a.d. September 12, 2012 ... The bait and switch is a fraudulent sales tactic that is punishable by US law as false advertising. IPSO FACTO.The bait and switch is a fraudulent sales tactic that is punishable by US law as false advertising. Though the law forbids this practice, it is commonly used, and people can find examples of it in virtually any advertising circular for online stores, major department stores, electronics, computer stores, and automobile retailers. The purpose of the tactic is to get customers to visit a store or business by advertising very low prices. Once the customer is in the store, the salespeople attempt to offer the customer different items at higher prices.This sales technique begins with the bait, an advertisement for a product at what seems like an extremely low price. Sometimes these products, such as a television, mattress,a computer, a phone are of very low quality, while at other times, the price may apply to one specific style or model of an item. In general, the bait is stocked in very low numbers. In some cases, only one or two are available at the low price.::::::::::::::::We even tried in the first NJ NANO Second to BUY the 32 inch TV online. Guess what SWITCH and BAIT happened again on AMAZON. Con Artists of America they are known as now. Haier 32 ' 720P TV Haier Number L 32A 2120 ( was ) a great consumer Fraud Deal IMHO.At 8:00 pm est ( NYC/NJ) We clicked , third in line and not TV Sets to be had? No volume of sets available listed either. AMZN ( AMAZON ) is getting like KMart now. showing things they do not want to sell but BAIT and SWITCH you. Congress should know on this FRAUD now.Why after it showed gone was it still able to be BOuGHT on AMAzon at the Much Higher price shown? Then suddenly now not available?As said by another reviewer on Amazon.com too:""What Amazon has done, however, is completely ruin any positive feedback they were going to get from offering this. To the contrary, Amazon is getting blasted on the deal websites. There are even multiple stories about people being told by Amazon's CSR's that they (meaning the CSRs) couldn't get in on the deal either as Amazon sold out so quickly. If true, you think customers like being told they were also competing against Amazon's employees to get in on this? And whether some smug reviewer on here agrees or not, that is not the kind of publicity Amazon was looking for when there are so many shopping alternatives available. """
I would never use Amazon again.  Their sellers over charge for shipping and the product never comes. They refuse to refund money and then shut your account down if you try to make a A-Z guarantee claim.
Bad customer service! I had to call three times and not once did i speak to a customer representative with good English.  
"I bought a top of the line Bosch 10"" saw blade from Amazon. A couple of weeks later they are selling the same blade for $37.00 less. Amazon refuses to refund the difference. I was told to send it back for a full refund (minus shipping) and buy another one at the lower price !!!Having to return this item for a refund and re buying the same so as to benefit from the lower price is simply ridiculous. I don't beleive Bezos has this kind of policies in his strategy to make Amazon ""Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company"".  Rona, Home Depot, Staples, Costco and most major retailers will match there own lower price and refund the difference if the item is still within the allowed return period; 30 to 90 days (Costco / 90 days), it just makes sense !I can not return my unused blade because I have thrown away the Bosch advertising that was inserted in the case. I definitely will think twice before ordering again from Amazon...and it probably will not be ""again soon"" "
Absolutely horrible!!! i am at the end of my semester and have been trying to solve this issue of my missing textbook well before hurricane sandy so that is no excuse!!!!! I still have yet to receive a book and finals are approaching! thanks amazon for absolutely nothing but a d*** headache!!!
I purchased an item from a seller on amazon and never got the item.  I contacted amazon and they told me to contact the seller.  I contacted the seller and they promised a refund but never followed through.  I then contacted amazon and they are telling me the seller stated they shipped the item and so I am not eligible for a refund. Wanna know what I did?  I told them to screw themselves and contacted my bank and also reported amazon to the BBB.  I got my money back ASAP!  That's how you deal with amazon because they are criminal from the very top to the bottom.
"Amazon sold me a used chainsaw as New.  It had signs of previous use and wear.  Furthermore; it had gas in the tank.  Now I have to dispose of the gas in order to ship it back.Within 30 minutes of receipt of this item, I was on the phone yelling at their Customer Service.Amazon, you've got a lot of nerve pulling that bait n switch.  I see this all over the internet about you.  You're developing a bad reputation with that shameful practice."
Amazon simply screws sellers-another seller abuse the rule. Avoid them if you can 
"Here is some good advice.  If you see anything in the automotive category ""sold by Amazon.com"" do not buy it.  There is a huge chance it will not fit your car.  I fell for this 4 times out of 6 orders. You are much better off purchasing from a 3rd party seller on Amazon.  And if something goes wrong, forget Amazon customer service.  All they do is send you email templates that don't even apply to the problem or question.  Its like they have monkeys working there just picking out templates to send based on keywords on your email, or maybe it is even just an automated system.  No idea, but it is not customer service.  You will not get a real written answer to any email you send to Amazon.  "
"Used to be a loyal Amazon customer, that is until I had to contact customer service.  I have never been treated so poorly in my life.  I will not shop there again."
"Amazon is terrible for sellers!! It allows buyers to lie and leave negative feedback for no reson except that they found a better product at a later date (and want to buy the other product) and want to make their case look better. It allows buyers to keep items for several weeks and then contact the seller to say that it is broken or not as described and that they want to return it!! Amazon is the worst and as a seller OR buyer, they will never get my business again!!!!!!!!!! BUYER and SELLER beware!!!"
"Bad experience!ordered a camera lens, they sent me empty box and created a replacement order right after i reported the issue which is great. ordered 3 ipads from third party but fulfill by amazon. they sent me 2 sand bags and an ipad. the ups delivery guy yelled into my face ""fuck"", and throw the package on the truck floor, he told me dont bother him because he has a lot of customers. the best part is, when i report the issue, amazon closed my account and told me that i am stealing from amazon.I would never shop on amazon ever again"
"Great results and easy ordering. Must watch if ordering several items not from same supplier. Shipping charges add up to more than the cost of the purchase. I can ship the same items for half of what I am charged, MAJOR RIP OFF!!!"
"I am pretty upset with Amazon.  I work in a local government agency where I am responsible for the purchasing of clothing and footwear for a large number of clients.  I have been a frequent Amazon customer.  I always look out for the free shipping as we are always working on a limiting budget and I am looking to save the government money.  I have noticed lately (due to client complaints) that some items were taking an excessively long time to come in, but it wasn't until I tracked a recent personal purchase of my own that I realized what was going on here with the apparently intentional delay in shipping packages.I was buying some parts to build a computer.  Just the basics, a motherboard with CPU, a case, and two 4GB sticks of ram.  I intentionally made sure that I bought all the items from Amazon instead of some other third party vendor.  I also made sure all the items were in stock as I didn't want there to be any sort of complications with my order.  Ironically, from what I understand now I probably would have been better off to go with one of the third party vendors on Amazon as they are required by Amazon to ship orders within 48 hours.  How Amazon can possibly justify not holding themselves to the same standard is beyond me.  I placed my order over the weekend.  I was really excited about it so I tracked it from the start.  On Monday my order status changed to shipping soon.  I started to worry though when the message said it should ship in a few hours to a few days.  A few days?!  All my items are in stock supposedly.  It should be a fairly simple matter to round them up and put them in a box and get them out to the shipper so I can enjoy building my new computer.   The next day when it still said the same thing I really got perturbed and decided I better do some research into this.  Then I found this thread with people describing a situation where it appears Amazon is deliberately delaying shipments:http://www.amazon.com/Shipping-anyone-getting-shipping-Amazon-/forum/Fx4HQD057HT5OQ/TxRFEIDS67V903/11/ref=cm_cd_notf_message?_encoding=UTF8&asin;=B000MG3LDA#MxAH1OWQ73YQC1I have purchased from numerous other vendors with free shipping and never experienced these sorts of delays.  On the third day after ordering my package, I followed the advice of a  poster from the “Super Slow Shipping” thread who said if they can't ship it on the third day then cancel your order.  Seems fair to me.  So I shopped around and found OutletPC.  I bought parts for an even better computer build for less money!  I was given free shipping since I purchased over $100 worth of items and my parts came in in under 2 days!  I ordered on a Wednesday and got the parts less than 48 hours later on Friday.  Judging from how Amazon apparently treats customers who choose Super Saver shipping, I doubt the would have even had my order shipped within a week.  I'll be taking my purchases elsewhere.  I am now in the process of testing  alternative suppliers of clothing and footwear since Amazon let me down."
"I used to be a prime member of Amazon and have spent lots of money there.  However, I've noticed increasing amounts of fake reviews on the site.  I contacted Bezos' office and received a nice reply.  After a few months, I noticed even more fake reviews, so I checked the product I initially emailed Amazon about - fake reviews still intact.  I emailed again but this time, rec'd no reply.  In addition, I've had increasing problems with poor quality products.  Yes, Amazon is always willing to take them back, but what a hassle.  I don't always manage to get things returned, as I'm sure a lot of people don't, and you can bet they bank on that.  And lastly, while they couldn't manage to curtail the fake reviews, they rejected several of mine because they were negative.  When I complained, they apologized, said it was an oversight, and then posted my reviews.  To me, all of this screams money grubbing dishonesty.  I believe the same type of thing happened to Ebay and to Etsy.  At first, they're great, and then they get greedy.  I've ceased to be a customer of all three.  I'd rather pay more and buy local, or do without, and take a stand against a dishonest, greedy company."
"Amazon is running a scam called Subscribe & Save.  This is how Amazon advertizes it:  “When you order through our Subscribe & Save program, you'll: • automatically receive a new shipment of the item in the monthly intervals you select • get a discount on our everyday price • get free shipping on every Subscribe & Save shipment • pay for each order only when the item is shipped • have the option to cancel at any time.”This is meant to apply to consumables that you may need on a periodic basis.  In reality, Amazon will charge you 10 times the price on the next shipment in the hopes that you will use the product before you realize how much you were charged.  The fine print in the Terms and Conditions includes the following:  “The total cost charged to your credit card for each Subscribe & Save order will be the cost of the item on the day the order is processed.”  Sounds innocuous right?  In reality, Amazon interprets this to mean that they have the right to charge you whatever they want after the first shipment even if it is 10 times more than the price.  The scam is that, since the product is consumable, Amazon hopes that you will consume it before you realize how much they charged you, since the charge goes on your credit card and you will not see your statement until the end of your cycle.  Here’s how it works:  They charge you 10 times more for the item, you consume it, you find out how much they charged, you call, they say that you can return it if you like, but it’s too late because you already consumed it and they get to keep 10 times the price.  I ordered a box of chewing gum for $10 with Subscribe & Save with the expectation of receiving a box every month.  Next month, they sent me another box and charged me $100 instead of $10.  I was lucky enough to notice the charge before I opened the box.  I called and they said that there is no mistake, that they have the right to change the price of any item however they choose without notifying me because of the sentence in the Terms and Conditions saying that I will be charged the cost of the item on the day the order is processed.  Needless to say, I returned the item, got a refund, and swore off Subscribe & Save. I wonder how many people began consuming the product before they found out how much they were charged and then had to accept the charge because they could not return the item.  This sort of practice can be expected from a fly by night operation not from Amazon.  It is really unfortunate that Amazon would resort to this type of egregious scam."
"They suck in terms of consistent order fulfillment. The past two orders I had with them were cancelled for no reason whatsoever. Called CS, and no further information. Then, on the most recent one (Amazon Wireless) they sent me an email to apologize and for me to go ahead and reorder. No thanks! I went to Wirefly and had my phone the next day. I had avoided Amazon for almost a year due to the last snafu, and after this issue for a wireless phone upgrade I will cross them off of my list."
Selling on Amazon is the WORST!!! OK if you want to wait up to 21 days for payment.NEVER AGAIN!!!
"Had customer service call me in reference to a Texas Instruments Ti-83 calculator bought used from them via their ""associate,"" ""Warehouse Deals, Inc.""  Item was shipped without the pirated CD manual and cord that was in the ebay-style picture.  Customer service acted like: 1) It was my fault; I ordered a ""USED"" item, 2) Only NEW calculators come with cords and cd's. I informed that NEW ones come with OEM packaging and manual materials. The pictures of the used ones are the ones that look like ebay pictures with a pirated cd and a cable, loose, on a homemade white background. Had to argue to get them to take it back. Screw these guys and Amazon too. If you want to be frustrated, be treated like an idiot, and have to sit through someone trying to get you to accept less than you were told you'd get, I'd highly recommend these jokers. BEWARE WAREHOUSE DEALS, INC. and AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE"""
"I have had an Amazon  account for several years but it seems as though in the past couple of years their ""customer service"" (and I use that term lightly) has been next to non-existant. I have received several packages from Amazon itself that have been poorly packaged and the new goods that I purchased have been received in poor or damaged condition. Oddly though the items received from outside sellers have been packaged correctly and the items were perfect. I have complained and cussed about previous shipments but went ahead kept them - too much trouble to repackage and return them. But they really got my goat on my last order. This time I went ahead and repackaged and returned it. I had ordered several items and when I got the package today a boxed set of DVD's that I had ordered was completely crushed and the box containing the movies was bent and mangled. Because they had tried to fit my whole order in a small box there was no room for protective packing material and the box itself was unable to fully close. The DVD's seemed to have absorbed the worst of the abuse during shipping and the other items were (for the most part anyway) undamaged. But I've had enough. Amazon has turned a deaf ear to me when I have tried to communicate with them before and I'm sure that will be the case now. It seems as though success has turned them into nothing more than a gigantic corporate entity unwilling to respond to the ""common man"". It's too bad, they used to be different and acted as though they really cared. I know that losing a customer (even a 10+ year one)will go completely unnoticed but maybe if they lose enough they may eventually realize that its people like us who made them a success. My daughter will miss her 8 hr. triple feature movie party tomorrow because I'm returning her movies but I am sick and tired of buying ""new"" items and receiving damaged goods. I'll run up to the local Best Buy and buy the set if need be, but no more settling for what Amazon chooses to give me for my money. "
"I have to agree with other reviewers, amazon has a bad customer service. Note that they don't take full responsibility for their sellers as long as they continue to make money for them for using their service.  I have recently ordered a 2TB My Passport USB hard drive from a ""Fortune Deal"" seller, and they sent me a 1TB HD for the half the price that I have paid for and they have not respond to request for a 2TB HD.  I have contacted amazon customer service, and they told me it's not amazon responsibility for any sellers on their site and said that I can contact the seller directly if I want to.  How can they not be responsible for all the sellers on their site when I purchased stuffs thought amazon. People should avoid buying stuffs from amazon anyway possible, because some sellers are scamming people on their site and amazon don't seem to care about it."
Customer service is non-existent. I had to wait over an hour to speak to a representative who didn't speak English. When i asked to speak to his supervisor i got disconnected.
"Scam!!!!! Amazon.com keeps delaying the refund for my order 103-5222590-5637048. I have been waiting for 2 months like a fool!I have been a loyal buyer for Amazon.com for some years. Recently I am very unhappy with one of my orders. I must write it to warn everyone.On 8 May 2012, I purchased some Kindles and accessories valued at $1244.94. Some minutes after I paid the order, I realized that I wanted to add something more. So I clicked the cancellation option. The second day I received an email from Amazon.com that my order was shipped in 2 shipments (UPS:1ZW0Y5420258373089;1Z8E26Y00355868145) ! Fine, then I contacted the online customer service team, the agent promised me to change the delivery address to their warehouses and give me back the refund. On 9 May 2012, I got $39.99 refund. (My order was shipped in two shipments, one valued $39.99 another valued $1204.95). But the higher valued shipment was not refunded. Then I contacted the online customer service team, my nightmare began.In May I should have contacted Amazon's online customer service team for 2 or 3 times. Their answers are like ""Ok, we got your problem, we need some time to investigate and refund you"". Fine, I understand that Amazon may need some time to figure things out. Then I just waited.On 11 June, I contacted Amazon's online customer service team again. There was a guy named Tauriq S chatted with me. After explaining him for one hour. He understood the problem and promised me to follow up. And he sent me an email saying ""I am sorry that your order 102-3552961-3444248 has not been refunded. I will follow up with you by 14 June 2012 regarding the progress of your refund.""Until 25 June, no body contacted me ever. Then I contacted the online customer service team again. I spent another hour to explain everything to the guy named Hariharan. What his conclusion was ""I see that the total cost for this order is $1,244.94. I'm unable to issue a refund for that much amount.So, please provide your phone number and I'll connect a call to our kindle technical team so that they can issue a refund for you."" Then Amazon arranged a phone conversation with me. Of course, I needed to spend another hour to explain to the telephone agent. The agent's name is Joanni C. After the conversation ended, she emailed me ""I'm following up on a phone call you made to our Customer Service department regarding on your refund for Order ID: 103-5222590-5637048. I've researched your account, and it looks like one of my colleagues has already working on it. I'm sorry for the delay, don't worry i'm going to make a follow up so that as soon as possible you will be able to received your refund for this items.""It is not surprised that my order was still not refunded. And no body ever contacted me again about the refund. On 7 July. I had to contacted them again. I talked to a guy named Craig v, this guy sounded quite polite and helpful. I had impression that my issue can be finally solved. After the conversation he emailed me ""Firstly, I do apologize again for the confusion around your request for a refund on order number 103-5222590-5637048. As it is a large amount, I have submitted the refund request to our accounts team who are looking into the matter. I assure you that I will call you on XXXXXXXXXX as soon as I have feedback from them. Thanks for your patience in working through this problem with me.""Today is 14 July, I am not surprised my order is still not yet refunded. I have been used to the bad customer service offered by Amazon.com.See if I can get my refund before August, while my order was placed on 8 May.Good luck everyone who buys from Amazon.comUPDATED on 18 July, I got my refund today. After I posted this review, Amazon's team quickly responded my request and called me back. Overall I am confident with Amazon.com, but this order was not handled well."
This is one company that cares nothing about customer service.  They will go out of their way to ignore and not help you.  Stay away.
"This is the worst online buying experience I’ve had in a decade.I bought a Geforce GTX680 on the 21st.  It’s now been a week and it’s still sitting at Amazon’s fulfillment center.My “mistake”? I selected “Free Shipping”.  Apparently that is a code-word for them thinking it’s okay to sit on my package a week before shipping it.  Interesting how Free Shipping on other sites such as Newegg does not correspond to a week of extra handling time?Their tracking is also very deceptive, and you can see this by comparing the Amazon tracking with tracking direct from FedEx.  They show it as “shipped” and “left seller facility” when they’ve actually only submitted the electronic information.  Then they list their fulfillment center as the first “Arrival” on the tracking making you think it’s moving along and on its way when it’ hasn’t even left their fulfillment center yet.  Nice way to add yet a few more days onto the handling time while making it seem on the surface like USPS/FedEx is just being slow.Does this business ever pass up an opportunity to mislead their customers for a quick buck?Update:  As of the 30th, the card is still not here.  I called them and surprisingly got an English speaking American on the phone that was very apologetic and helpful.  There was nothing he could do to get it to my house faster at this point but he did give me a $25 credit.  Still a pretty terrible experience overall but at least they do actually care on some level."
"This review is about Amazon's policy of allowing sellers to ignore customer emails and do nothing about it. I was told by an Amazon CSR that there is a policy that sellers must follow regarding responding to customer inquiries, however, they do not give seller contact info to buyers, nor will they (Amazon)contact the non-responsive sellers directly. I sent two emails, one on 6/06/12 and one on 6/10/12, to ""Blue Light Bargains"", which is a seller on Amazon, and have not received any answer to this date (6/27/12). I find Amazon's policies regarding their sellers lack of responses to buyer emails both negligent and ignorant. I received an answer from the last Amazon CSR I emailed that the problem was being addressed by another department (Amazon's ""Technical Team"") and I would hear a response from them in two days--that was on 6/20/12 and still no answer after seven days. If this is any example of Amazon's approach to customer service, then I urge anyone who buys on Amazon to think twice about making a purchase there. Amazon simply does not care about it's customers--I guess that's what happens when a company gets as big as they are."
"Ordered blue ray dvd 2 weeks ago..never got it.. i canceled order. Amazon rep asked me to reorder item and said they would ship 24 hour service, their mistake.  Reordered... still hasnt shipped 2 days later.. Call to customer service no help... they dont see anything more than i do... just still waiting to be shipped... NO mo Amazon for me"
"Although prices are good, the shipping at Amazon is the worst I've dealt with. In stock items can take up to a week to ship. I've had to cancel orders due to the erratic shipping from Amazon. I'd rather pay a little more to a place like Newegg or Barnes & Noble than deal with Amazon again.And the worst part? They could care less about it."
"Locked my account for no reason, no email communication, and the customer service can't say what's going on for several days now.  Looks like site management is changing, and not for the best.  I used to spend quite a bit of money here, but now will have to take my business somewhere else."
Avoid Amazon.com!!  They are now just a fake storefront for other web sellers and are loaded with crooked sellers that rip you off.  Amazon states that they offer safety for purchases because they offer their own amazon A to Z protection if a seller doesn't deliver product as advertised.  I tried this after a horrible experience with amazon making a purchase through amazon.com and amazon does not really accept or honor these claims as advertised.  Avoid amazon at all costs.  Amazon.com just hides behind their big website and do not really offer any real guarantee that their site is secure or that you won't be ripped off.     Amazon.com is haven for crooked ripoff sellers in their marketplace.  
"Amazon is NOT a quality shipping company.I enjoy acceptable service from amazon and their 3rd party vendors (when I buy CD's) often the jewel cases get cracked; but I tried to buy computer parts this time because they were several dollars cheaper than Newegg and usually ship amazon fast.  I selected the items I wanted and amazon told me in the cart that one item would be shipped separately so I deleted it and found a different one so that all would come from Amazon itself and not any vendor or outside warehouses -- the cart said all would ship together.  Well they didn't.  They sent three packages by 2 different shipping companies and one is still not here.  Newegg would have had all the stuff delivered by the 3rd or forth day even if it came from different distribution locations.  The box that this computer Case came in was not packed securely by the ""Amazon box stuffers"" and it arrived damaged.  I guess that amazon will just have to phase out all the physical products and fulfillment crap and just stick to the cloud and electronic delivery of music and books.  Amazon is NOT a quality shipping company."
"Horrible, Do not buy anything from amazon. They have terrible vendors on their website, and when these vendors rip you off or send you the wrong item(which is what happened to me) they just blow you off. I have been just trying to return an item bought off Amazon from one of their vendors with a perfect rating and after a weeks still have not received my return shipping labels via email. I call this company each day and they just put me on hold never to pick up again. I have contacted Amazon, and they do nothing about their thief vendor. This never has happened with google checkout or Paypal. Paypal is the best, they will actually take the money back via credit card and give back to you if they have an unwilling vendor. Do not Trust Amazon. "
"I rarely write reviews, anywhere, but Amazon has finally done something that I cannot let slide. A brief history of my time with Amazon.com: I easily spend  $3-4000 there every year and have been doing so for many years. I'm an Amazon Prime member because I like free 2nd day shipping. Returns are fairly easy as well. Now, on to my issue. It is regarding Amazon's trade-in program. I recently purchased a new iPad and read decent reviews about Amazon's trade-in program, so I thought I would try it. It seemed a lot less painful that using eBay. I do use eBay but the trade-in program was ridiculously easy. I'm starting to understand why now. My original iPad was purchased brand new, from Apple.com in April 2010. When it arrived, I opened it using my nitrile gloves and immediately installed a screen protector and rear case plastic protector. Then, on top of the rear plastic, I put on my hard plastic case. When I removed all the protective covers, to send it to Amazon, it looked exactly like it did when I opened the Apple box in 2010. It was in mint physical and operational condition. It even shocked me a little. So, I felt 100% confident to request the most for this trade-in. It looks brand new, why wouldn't I want top dollar. So I send it in, in the original Apple iPad box and Apple shipping box. It had all original accessories and documentation. So, I check my email today and was notified that they are returning it to me because of ""minor scratches"". I beg to differ heavily on that! This iPad rarely left my room, much less experience anything to add wear and tear to it. So, I was thanking my stars that I clicked on the ""return"" button when it asked me if I wanted the lower value they offer or if I wanted it back. I want it back! I'm not getting low-balled and screwed out of $50.00 because Amazon hasn't seen an iPad in mint condition. I would be willing to bet good money that they have never issued the maximum dollar amount for pretty much anything that wasn't factory sealed. So, now I am off to start sourcing my goods elsewhere. I cannot trust a company that is this blatantly fraudulent. Instead of using my Amazon app and enjoying prime, I'll vote with my wallet and use google to find the same products elsewhere. They'll lose more than the $50.00 they should have given me on an obviously perfect trade-in. My advice to anyone considering using their trade-in program, know your product and opt to have it sent back because amazon will offer you the lowest price no matter what the condition. Don't sacrifice money for convenience. I'll be putting this baby on eBay and taking my chances. Good luck to everyone else."
"Do not purchase from Amazon.  I can't even express how disappointed I am with their service.  I have a prime account and have used it to place many orders in the past, but their automotive section is clearly beta.  I specifically always selected items sold by Amazon directly, not any of the other merchants listes, so that I could take advantage of the Prime shipping.  Let me tell you, not only is Amazon late in shipping anything automotive, they always ship the wrong part, as their vehicle selection is all wrong.  After 3 orders in a row like this, I had to cancel my Prime account."
"Ordered a Monitor Arm and Bracket for my Samsung monitor on 3/5.  They sent out the arm right away and the bracket was supposed to be sent in 2-3 weeks.  I noticed other places going out of stock on the bracket so I emailed amazon making sure they were going to send it or else I was going to order it from somewhere else.  They assured me not to worry(it was a template email, but I foolishly believed them).  3/28 rolls around and they cancel my order saying can't get the bracket now and pretty much tell me too bad.  All the other sites are now OOS on the bracket.So i have an arm and no way to attach it to my monitor because they couldn't simply look into the matter for me when I emailed them.They then proceed to tell me to buy it from a third party seller on their site for 3 times as much.Amazon has a nice site, but their Customer Service is useless and uninformed and they really don't care about you, just your money. "
"I use to use Amazon often. Recently, I order my parents a phone. Amazon cancelled the order without contacting me. They decided someone stole my credit card.... fine. I reorder the phone for my parents. The second phone was paid for and shipped very fast no problem. Amazon had charged my card for the cancelled order. They didn't just cancel it, they deleted it entirely so none of the customer service agents could even find it. After a month of phone calls and arguing I finally got a refund and was told to keep the second phone. Can't return something that there is no record of shipping. HORRIBLE experience."
"As a seller there is no protection on here and I'm sure the big companies selling major merchandise have savvy lawyers making sure they are properly covered to sue if need be.  I have been treated terribly by the customer service, that is when I can get to speak with someone, about my claim.  Basically a buyer walked away with my Mac and was refunded the money when he filed a false claim about it's condition.  Thank you Amazon for screwing a poor college student trying to pay my bills by selling my personal belongings!  Novice sellers be careful.  I'll never sell or buy on Amazon and I'm sad because I would have like to buy a tablet down the road."
"GOING DOWNHILL FAST!!!  I've cancelled two orders for computer equipment with Amazon.com within the last week because they haven't shipped the orders after 3 or 4 days even though the items are in stock.  I ordered them from another merchant at a lower price who always ships within 24 hours.  Amazon.com used to ship that fast, but not lately.I have also noticed that some of their items they sell for over the manufacturer's list price.  They inflate the manufacturer's list price on their site so it looks like you are getting a discount."
"Amazon is awful.. actually worse than awful. They used to have good customer service teams, efficient checkouts and good products.  I'm totally disappointed in the 13$ I've been offered for a trade in for two Kindles that failed. I spent 200$ on these things a year and a bit ago and they failed.  This is a horrible disappointment and they are offering me nothing in return.  Dont use them ever!"
"We bought a ""new"" IPAD 2 for a gift on 7-31-2010.  Now 5 months later, registering it a second time with Verizon, we are told it is showing STOLEN!  We have written to the seller ....Wireless Wholesale...and have rec'd NO RESPONSE.  I have searched the web for ANY info on this seller and have found NOTHING...no contact info, NADA!  There was a small company in MI that had a similar name as ""WIRELESS WHOLESALE"".... but not the Amazon seller either!Amazon (after going online and FINALLY locating a corporate customer service phone NUMBER in Seattle, WA), they say ""there is nothing they can (will) do.....so much for all those Amazon GUARANTEES for buyers satisfaction.  They said call our bank and see about a refund based on buying stolen merchandise!When I called the bank, the bank employee had the same thing happen to her ON AMAZON with an expensive phone...!!!!!  She left harsh messages everywhere with no results so finally told her story on the FEEDBACK section, like I am doing now! I have bought many, many items from AMAZON over the years but I have placed my last order as of right now!!!!!!!!!  How dare they offer a product on their site, through another seller (that one assumes that they endorse!) and then not stand behind an $800 item when it shows up as STOLEN!   THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO KEEP BUSINESS!  I'll post this info ALL OVER THE NET and hopefully protect others from this beast called ""AMAZON""!"
Not a happy camper. Ordered some supplies for my RV and after a long time of waiting I come to find out I didn't actually purchase from Amazon but from a merchant who advertises on Amazon. Amazon charges the card but the outside merchant sends the order. Hope the merchandise will arrive before my cross country trip.
"Bought a book from Amazon, thru their partner 'Wonderful'This book is for a class I am taking in graduate school.Paid for overnight.A week later, no book, no shipping information, no tracking on Amazon's site.Contacted seller.  Seller has been rude, insulting and completely unhelpful.Filing a dispute with my credit card company and re-ordering from an honest and reliable book seller.And will flunk my first assignment due to the incompetence of this seller."
"For buyers it may be decent for they don't care at all about their sellers and participate in theft from their own sellers. They allow a customer to purchase a product, then say they don't like it and want their money back. They give the seller 7 hours in the middle of the night to appeal the claim before allowing the customer to keep the product and get a full refund of all costs including shipping. They take 21.5% of the selling price from the seller, allow the customer to keep the product and don't refund the seller even the cost of shipping. Then they give you a run around and say there is no phone number to contact their seller claim support only email which in turn tells you you're out of luck. This is probably the worst company I have ever dealt with. Highest fees, worst customer support and what middle man can openly be part of stealing from their own sellers?"
"Amazon UK made a very expensive mistake when they accidentally sent me 2 ipods worth over £300 instead of my military wives CD. Doing the right thing I contact Amazon straight away as I realised someone would probably be missing Christmas presents. The first person told me to package the items, queue at the post office (a week before Christmas) and pay for the postage - stating they would reimburse the postage later if/when the items were received back at Amazon. Several phone calls later I now have to wait in for the items to be collected on 3rd January by a courier (they should never have been sent through the Royal Mail originally as they contain Lithium batteries). I have been advised it may be 9.30 am or sometime between 9am and 4.30 p.m!! And what do i get for my good samaritan deeds? A £5 voucher to spend at the unreliable Amazon! "
Poor customer service. Bad replacement policiesI placed an order with amazon only to have it damaged in shipping. UPS sent it back to amazon. They never contacted me relating to the order at all. There was a Xmas present in the order and it was due prior to Xmas. When I finally was able to get a hold of Customer service they told me that I had to re-do the entire order and I would be refunded for the first order within 4 weeks or I could just get a refund for the entire order in 4 weeks... They would not just replace the order and send me replacements.. Poor policies. Non communication of lost shipments and they like to hang onto your money for a long time. Very bad customer service. This was my first time ever buying from them and it is now my last. I will also be telling my friends about the poor service and making sure that I have them make their purchases elsewhere online.
"I ordered a Kindle Fire for my wife for Christmas on the 20th of December with 2 day shipping. It's still not here. When I contacted Amazon about this on the 23rd they said too bad - it's coming on the 28th which is obviously more than two days. Then they want me to spend $80 to join Amazon Prime so I can get ""free"" two day shipping. Well Jeff Bezos - your two day shipping takes 8 days so no thanks. I don't need that rip off. If you can't trust them for smaller items, how can you trust them for larger items like tv's and appliances? I'm going to stick with someone like Abt.com. They have an actual store and real people to talk to."
Ordered a diamond palm tree necklace and it NEVER came. Called amazon and they since since from a third party (Katarina) they have to investgate which take 2 weeks and MAYBE i'll get half the money back and I'd have to contact the seller to get the rest of my money back! I did contact the seller many of times and no answer and no response to email!! Amazon let's people sell items on there site but you might or might not get your item or your money back! This was a gift for my wife on christmas - now I'm a 100 bucks short and have to go spend another 100 somewhere else to get her another gift. Bottom line don't buy from AMAZON or  Katarina jewerly they will screw you in the end! 
"Amazon.co.uk Never Again! Would never shop here again, really poor customer service, really poor communications/relations. Absolute nightmare. Never again will shop in Amazon.co.ukIf you are looking for a nightmare, please shop at Amazon.co.uk"
"Amazon has been my favorite online store, and I have bought thousands of dollars of electronic equipments from them until now. I ordered a Pelican 1510 with a picture of a lid organizer included with the package. They told me to return the package and they will send me a case with the lid organizer, they sent me the same package without the lid organizer again. I called them complaining and operator Natasia, was very rude and disrectful, and just changed my mind about buying again from Amazon. Their customer service quality has deteriorated lately, go someplace else to buy your stuff, because it was clearly a deceptive practice and misrepresentation. By the way the lid organizer is $22.00, as you can see it is not about the money, it is about getting good customer service, which Amazon doesn't have right now."
"Price Gouging!  A kindle ebook should not cost as much as a paperback!  When I bought my Kindle, ebooks were almost half the price of the hard cover or paperback version.  I am getting rid of my Kindle if I can have the paperback version of a book for the same price."
"Is it just me or is Amazon's service deteriorating? I've had an issue with several orders lately with Amazon. Supposedly, I was to receive a package containing 3 study materials within 2 days (since I have Amazon Prime). They lost the package and didn't even bother to inform me! I had to go to Live Chat to see what was up and now they're telling me they're re-ordering it for me! Had I had needed the books in a timely manner, I would have been much more upset. If I wanted my shipments to get lost in transit and waste time researching the issue myself, I would've ordered the books from China. I might have had a better chance of receiving them by now if I did. Secondly, they send me a shoddy product and when I order the replacement, they tell me that it's delivered and that I will ""receive no more updates about this product"" when it hasn't even been delivered!!! After talking to live chat, I'm to find out that it's with the USPS and that it'll be delivered to me within a few days. Basically, I figured out that their tracking service was their way of tracking the package only to my local post office. Is the post office going to pay for the item too? Is this Amazon's way of cutting corners when they estimate a shipping date?Needless to say, I will NOT be renewing my Amazon Prime subscription. I would have never subscribed to Amazon Prime if I had known that ""2"" day shipping sometimes means 4 or 5."
"I recently had the misfortune of trying to purchase a coat on Amazon this past Friday.  I tried to purchase two Michael Kors Men's Button-Front Coats.  However, there was an error with their system and I was not allowed to purchase the coats.  Amazon acknowledged the error on their part and told me that someone would get back to me. Their response was as follows: ""We recently learned you may not have been able to take advantage of a limited-time Lightning Deal on Black Friday due to technical issues on the Amazon.com website, so we would like to offer you an Amazon.com promotional credit of $5.00 on your next Amazon.com purchase.""  So they admit that it was their fault and instead of purchasing a coat that retailed for $395 and was on sale for $99, I was offered instead a $5 credit, not to be used for electronics and it will expire on 12/2/2011.  A good store would make it right and allow me to go ahead and make the purchase.  An average store would apologize for the incident and state they are trying to ensure it never happens again.  A terrible retailer would respond the way Amazon did and insult their customers.  Really, $5 and restrict when and what you can use it on.  Just terrible."
"This store is dishonest with there ""free super saver"" shipping option.  The terms fail to explain that they will sit on your order anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks before it even ships, especially if they are busy.My experience is that it ships same day when selecting the much more expensive 2 day shipping option.  It sure seems like this store is trying to push people into signing up for the huge revenue boosting $79 prime membership.  The kicker was that when I called for the most recent order after 48 hours of waiting for it to ship, customer service could not even provide a estimate of when it would ship.  Well guess what Amazon, your tactics do not work on me.  I just took my current $370 worth of buisness and as well as future orders somewhere else.    "
"BEWARE.  Amazon.com allows their third party sellers to participate in unethical business practices.  My order was placed through Amazon on a saturday evening to an item a third party seller had listed.  The price had been dropping all day long and I finally decided to place an order.  The order was accepted.  Sunday morning I get an email saying the order was cancelled, the item was out of stock.  Went back to Amazon to purchase from another seller and found the exact same item for sale by the same seller.  Only difference was the price was now $5 more! Contacted customer service about this issue but was told there was nothing could be done.  To make matters even worse, once my order was cancelled, it was like there was no record of the transaction at all at Amazons website so I couldn't even rate the seller who performed this unethical behavior."
"I ordered archos tablet and accessories at amazon.ca, but then i received an email that the address of the billing of my card was not the right one for my card. So, i reply and give the right billing address of my card. but then i still receive an email that my order was onhold due the the wrong billing address..so i email it again, now i received an email, mail delivery failure. So, i log in using my account and password, but then i can't not log in, but when i register, it accepted my username and password. so i reset my password again and log in using the new reset password, nothing happen, i still unable to log in. i emailed then, but they didn't response my email, in fact i received a mail failure again. so, i still email them and told them to cancel my order. Until, now i still didn't receive a reply what going on,why im not able to log in... It' s worst customer service that i ever had, i been ordering online store, but it's only amazon.ca was worst. i'm not happy dealing with them...so peaple be aware///"
"They used to be reliable, but now they're playing the eBay game of offering products sold and shipped by others,and if you are unforunate enough to need to return one of those, good luck.  They won't help you.  In spite of your placing the order with them, they'll refer you to a no-name source to get a refund.And their Philippines-based customer telephone support is bad, real bad."
I use Amazon.com but they are my last choice. I only use them when I cannot find something somewhere else.  The problem is their shipping policy.  I can understand when you select free shipping that they are going to ship by the least expensive method and that might not be the quickest. I can accept that.  What I cannot accept is the fact is that they sit on the order and do not process it for four days when you select free shipping.  You order something on Monday and it doesn't ship until Friday.  That is unacceptable and it appears that it is only a punitive measure.  They apparently want to make sure you really do have to wait if you select free shipping since once it is shipped it arrives in 2-3 days.  This has happened not once but several times so it is not an exception but a pattern.
"Have had problems with my last 4 transactions with Amazon and am done.  Their system is unreliable as you can buy an item, have your credit card charged and get a receipt but then days or weeks later, the transaction magically disappears from their system as if it never happened.  I didn't have this problem in the past but recently on shoes, electronics, & clothing.  I suppose they figure most of their sheep will continue coming back.  The last purchase that actually shipped was delayed at every phase of the shipping process.  Amazon didn't ship the items until after the estimated delivery date, 10 days, then they shipped via the FedEx ground, which took 5 business days from the Amazon warehouse to a Dallas address.  WTF."
"I have placed 5 orders with Amazon over the last 2 years. I started with Christmas gifts for my wife 2 yrs ago, when 3 of the 4 books arrived for her. More recently, I have tried placing 4 orders with them. Of the 4 orders that I placed with them, 2 were cancelled because the vendor ws out of stock. When I ordered cell phones from them, the vendor still had them in stock even after they were scheduled to arrive at my house. It always said shipping soon, even after the approximate delivery date had passed. I ordered a computer from them that only had a quantity of 3, so I assume that was the reason it was cancelled. The next 2 orders were placed on hold by account specialists. The first one dealt with some cell phones to replace the ones that were cancelled amd the fact that when I learned that I could ship some items overseas directly, that is where i had it shipped. The account specialist placed my account on hold for 2 days, then did another 3 day investigation, informing me that my account had been compromised, which it hadn't, and they were closing my account. I needed to register for a new account and a new card. I used another account that I had and ordered the cell phones, this time shipping them to myself, and the order was placed on hold as the account specialist used the wrong credit card as well as the wrong address for the account. I am still waiting to get this resolved."
"Terrible site. Didn't fulfill my OneSale order for a touchpad then sends me a link to a significantly higher priced tablet. When I asked for a credit of $30, they refused and said they weren't crediting people that amount, when I know for a fact hundreds of others had been credited that amount. "
"I must inform every about amazons subscribe and save feature. It's some shady business going on here. I've been an amazon customer for nearly 10 years. I noticed this feature and decided to give amazon another try. I made my first subscription and not even before I could receive my first item, they have already increased the price for my subscription! In just 1 week  the prices have already gone up. This is a scam everyone! You don't even get prime shipping on the items if your a prime member! With a the price increase I could just get 2nd day shipping from any other website. This is more like subscribe and pay more money without being informed!! I mean, I would have at least expected to get 1 shipment before there was a price increase! I've let many issues with amazon slip by, and I've even lost money because they have sent me the wrong items. But I let those go and continued to order from them. But this is just absolutely absurd now. They are running a shady business now! Will cancel my account now.---I full understand the policy. Sure prices will fluctuate; but not even allowing your customers to receive at least 1 discounted item, it pretty much renders this feature pointless. The feature is Subscribe and SAVE. Now how the hell am I suppose to save anything if the prices are being increased 1 week into my subscription. For christ sakes, I didn't even get an opportunity to save! In fact, had I not check my subscription I would have ended up paying more!I'm furious because I feel deceitful activity going on.Sounds to me like subscribing and unknowingly paying more so AMAZON can save money on shipping, just so they don't have to pay for 2-day freight for all their prime members..I had even subscribed to another item but now I have cancelled everything because if this incident. "
"Avoid. Ordered HP Touchpad. Received confirmation email. Status was ""shipping soon"". Sat that way for four days. Then received notice that email was cancelled. Taking future business elsewhere."
"Terrible customer service. I ordered an electronic device from them on 8/21/2011 and their site said the seller had 27 items in stock. Four days later they sent me an email stating that their seller had run out of stock. I have been an amazon.com customer and prime member for over 10 years and spent thousands of dollars shopping there. When I called them to ask for a price match from another of their sellers or the manufacturer they declined to do so. I requested a refund on my prime membership and canceled all open orders with them. I told the CSR that I will never do business with them again and she didn't care. When I asked for a supervisor she said none were available but she will have one call me. Three days have passed and no call. Boo amazon, I'm done with you."
"very bad service, cheating lying and dishonest company"
"My first and likely last experience with Amazon was horrible.  I placed a order for the hp touchpad this weekend only to have it canceled 4 days later.  Because Amazon stated on my order that my item was in shipping status, I passed up other places I could of gotten a touchpad from.  Now I have no touchpad and Amazon is still holding my money 6days into this scam. Never again...."
"Ordered HP Touchpad from onSale through amazon. I got an immediate confirmation saying my order was received. Monday my credit was charged. Tuesday the order vanished from my amazon account. I still have no email , no communication from either amazon or onSale. onSale, what a crappy retailer. Shame on amazon to let them get a storefront on amazon. No accountibility. No communication. Will not buy from them in the future."
"Horrible experience. Do not put your trust in confidence with any sellers on amazon.  They do not follow through and protect you from their authorized resellers. Purchased an item from amazon.com via a third party seller. This seller kept me in limbo for 3 days saying they would be shipping soon and on the third day canceled the order, because they sold items they did not have in inventory.  Now both companies point the finger at each other, leaving the customer holding the empty bag. BUYER BEWARE"
"Order two HP TP on Saturday evening where I can ordered them from HP or Bestbuy at that time. Then got cancelation email on Wed afternoon. In Wed evening I called the CS and this is the first time in my life to call Amazon customer service after buying stuff from Amazon for seven years. And the experience is the worst among all experience with all kinds of customer service. The first representative is fine. But after she transfered my call to the manager with ID 7049, this guy is definitely the most arrogant representative I have ever seen. He calimed:1. It is my ""PERSONAL CHOICE"" to order in Amazon on Saturday evening even though I can order for the same price on HP and Bestbuy at that time.2. I waste him 8 minutes to discuss this issue that he claimed Amazon has no responsibility even though I waste more than 80 mintes to call Amazon no mention other time spending on this oderd. 3. No compensation is possible even someone already got credits from Amazon and BN compensate 20GC for all customers with cancelation of TP. Next time, go to Bestbuy or other place to order stuff and DO not trust Amazon as before."
"Horrible seller , selling product they do not have in stock and taking four days to notify that order has to be cancelled .Do not buy from these crooks!!!!!"
I too was wrapped up in the Amazon and OnSale mess. Very disappointed in how this was handled by both Amazon and OnSale.I would have expected better from Amazon. Allowing orders to go through knowing the product was not in stock and putting a hold on customers CC. Waiting 3 days to notify people that their orders had been canceled. OnSale should be banned from Amazon so this does not happen again.
"The onSale touchpad fiasco is deeply disappointing. There are no checks on inventory and no consumer protection, Amazon caused thousands of people that trusted it down and their only action is an ""investigation"" no forcing to find the product no lawsuits no nothing, were just left to pay 3 times as much from ebay... sad"
Amazon becomes worse and worse. It is a dishonest company. They simply cancel the order without any reason.
"EXTREMELY disappointed in the apparent lack of solidity between Amazon.com, and its merchants.  Placed an order for what Amazon.com had shown as ""In Stock""  three days worth of waiting, and FINALLY they send an email telling me that my orders had been cancelled.  Three days wasted of my life I'll never get back, and will Amazon.com or onSale.com compensate?  Not anything other than a ""We're sorry we inconvenienced your life, and told you falsely advertised something we didn't have control over.  Please shop with us again, however."""
Amazon needs to drop Ensenda as their shipping provider for my area.TOTAL GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ensenda can rot in h*** and so can Amazon for using those crooks.
"Amazon has great prices and typically fast shipping. If you have to contact their customer service, however; you might as well contact a wall!Amazon's customer service is abysmal at best. They only use templates when they respond to you and they cannot thing outside the box!I had an order which shipped late and chatted with them to ask about it as it was a wedding gift. When I asked the agent, instead of answering my question, he used a template that stated orders ship from different warehouses based on availability. He tried explaining that they could use whatever shipping method they chose to get the order there on time. THIS WASN'T WHAT I ASKED. What does the warehouse the order is shipping from have to do with it shipping on time? I emailed them advising them how annoying this was, so they offered my a $10.00 credit. This is a slap in the face considering my order was $300.00. Thank you for your 3.33% credit! At least offer 10% if you are going to offer something! On top of that, the agent forgot to issue the credit and the following agent is telling me to place an order and they will just refund the $10.00. Ugh!"
I ordered a cat6 belkin cable from one of the stores on amazon.com and this store sent me some other brand that was not even close to what the brand I ordered was. It was much lighter and a lot less all the way around.I paid $18.00 for 1 14ft cable you would think they could send what I ordered. Do not use amazon and save yourself some time and money. You will not get what you order. USE NEWGG.COM and you will get what you ordered and you will pay alot less shipping than with amazon.com. Think it over befor you order and use a store you can trust. Amazon.com is not it. I know I have had more than one issue with them and they do not turn out in your favor very much of the time.Like 1 out of 6 times for me and all I wanted was what I ordered not some other off brand crap and in the time I paid for it to be shipped to me. 2 Day shipping with newegg is you get it in 2 days from the day you order it.With amazon you get it when they want to ship it to you and what ever brand they have on hand it dose not count what the adds say about the brands you order. You may get it but I would not count on it. This is what I have found trying to use amazon so think it over befor you order and just use newegg the first time. It will save you time and money.*****ADDED AFTER I FILED A CLAIM WITH AMAZON*********It is now 6/19/2011 and I did get a refund on this order but you see how long it did take to get it.****(SATISFACTION4U)was the name of the store I ordered from and I can tell you to stay away from this store.They have not sent me the right item even after they sent an e-mail saying they would if I removed the bad review on amazon's site.I have not and will not until they send me what I ordered and paid for. It is sad I can not trust the stores on amazon to be like amazon is.AMAZON seems to try and do the right thing but takes way to much time doing it.Just trying to make the stores do it right the first time would work for me.The most upsetting part of all this is the store still has it listed as belkin on the amazon add today.What I was sent was not even close to a belkin brand item it is much much lighter.So I will have to tell you to just go to newegg.com and get it the first time.It will save you time and money.Someone should fix this and other issues with amazon befor this stuff runs it into the ground.I will not be ordering anything from amazon ever again.Think it over befor you order and use a store that will get it right the first time like newegg.com.(Satisfaction4u)
"I've been a loyal customer of Amazon until now. They advertise to give a free next-day shipping for the purchase of a high-priced GPS. I ordered on Thursday with the hope of getting it on Friday, as advertised/promised, for my upcoming trip in the weekend. Everything seems to be on tracked on my order until Friday comes. They emailed me on Friday and say that it will not be delivered until the following week. They should have let me know on Thursday that they can't make it to my house by Friday so that I have the time to hunt for a different deal from other websites!!! Or may be they should have advertised as ""Free 5-day shipping!!!"" to make it more accurate of how they handle their shipping & handlings.Now I know why such a big website like Amazon does not ACTIVELY participate here."
"bought battery from 3rd party (brainydeal.com) through amazon.com. after 14 months it failed to recharge. was 2 mo beyond warranty, but a 9 cell lithium-ion should last much longer. it was only recharged about 7 times. neither retailer would help event though obviously was a defective battery."
"Hi,   I never had any previous bad experience with Amazon.com. This is by far the worst experience I ever had with Amazon. I almost wasted 2 hours on the phone call for nothing but trying teach amazon CSR some basic maths. here is the storyI wanted to buy LG Infinia 55LW5600 TV from amazon after pricematching with Frys.com Amazon price : 2159.99Frys.com Price: 1199.00difference - 960.99When I talked to CSR he confirmed the price with Frys and said that he would match it, suddenly he stated that frys charge shipping (but they have a free store pickup option) and said that he would add $199 to the total amount to accommodate the shippingEven though amazon had always pricematched and shipped items for free(I'm a prime member)I eeven agreed to $199 shipping costs now the total difference is 960.99 - 199 = 761.99during the order I already had the Amazon Promotional credit of $50 in my accountso It automatically applied that credit to my order total and showed as 2109.99 The CSR now told me that he cannot reduce 761.99 out of the order he can only do 711 out of the order I did not understand the logic, this is basic maths why would they want to apply 711 instead of 761.99I tried explaining them all the possible mathematics but no use the CSR explanation was like this: you paid 2109.99 - 1199 (frys price) - 199(shipping) = 711(he did not know where the 99 cents went) I know that amazon price match does not include promotion discount but what I had was not a promotional discount it was a Promotional gift CreditThis is the worst experience I ever had with amazon related to price match and buying something. they even cancelled the orderI hope this issue is taken in to serious consideration"
"I have used Amazon.com many times before and have never been treated like just recently.  I ordered a D7000 camera for 1199.95 plus tax and got a confirmation email from them.  I payed with a confirmed checking account which contained $2235.35. They claimed it was declined and rather than changing the payment method they cancelled the order immediately.  When I check online to order again, the price is magically $1350 and I contacted them to honor they price we agreed to.  Here's the transcript:You are now connected to Javeed from Amazon.com.Me:I ordered a Nikon d7000 and even have a confirmation of the order but it was cancelled ""order(s) (104-4060016-2195434) using payment from your bank account.Unfortunately it is not possible to change the payment method for this order. Therefore, it has been cancelled.""I want item at the price it was advertised and the price I ordered it. Now it's showing over 200 dollars more if I try to place the order again. I think that is wrong.Javeed:Hello, my name is Javeed.

It's as simple as that.Javeed:If the error would have been from our end I would have honoured you the price difference Craig.Since the charge wad declined from your bank end I'm unable to honor the price.Me:there is no error on my endyou cannot show me any proof that it was even declinedJaveed:We don't have any info why your bank declined the charge Craig.Me:you dont have any proof that it was even declinedJaveed:TeleCheck processes our direct debit payments. Please call TeleCheck at 1-800-366-2425 so that they can better assist you with the issue.can they give me a camera at the price amazon and i agreed to?because that's what i wanti can pay with a cardJaveed:No Craig, we'll be unable to honor the price.I'm sorry about this.Me:ok, i have this transcript and will be sharing it on rating sitesi'm finished with amazonill be shopping your competitorsprimarily brick and mortar placesJaveed:I'm sorry about that.Me:not sorry enough to honor the price we agreed toJaveed:Due to our strict policies I'm unable to honor the price difference Craig.Me:see you on the rating sites thenJaveed:Thank you for contacting Amazon. We hope to see you again. Have a great day.Javeed from Amazon.com has left the conversation.He never offered ANY remedy.  Thanks alot amazon. I am pretty sure they changed the price and don't want to sell it for the original price and cancelled the order.  If it was a simple payment problem, they would have let me change the payment method.  They lied plain and simple."
"After ordering an Asus tablet through amazon, I received a confirmation email from amazon that my order is being processed, I find out the next day that I actually got put on the pre order list. After speaking with amazon on the issue, the small print in my email notification that stated ""we will notify you when we have any information on your package"" actually means ""Your too late, and now your on the Pre-order list"". Other resellers such as newegg and tigerdirect automatically notify you that your item is back ordered, or simply will not fulfill the transaction in instances like this where your item sells out while your finalizing your transaction. It seems amazon does this on purpose to avoid any out of stock cancellations which is at the customers expense. If they would of notified me, I would of cancelled my order and placed it through one of the retailers that did have the item. Its looking like I now have to wait at least a month to get this item. This will be the last time I deal with these clowns."
"I ordered some noodles last month and until now I have not received anything! This is what I think. If Amazon is selling and shipping the products they are always on time. But when 3rd party is selling them, they always have some issues. I won't be buying from 3rd party amazon sellers from now on. This is the 3rd time it happened in my last 9 purchases from amzon. Enough is enough.Amazon needs to do something with screening out all these bad sellers."
"I ordered the Mortal Kombat Kollector's edition over a month early expecting them to ship it to arrive on within a couple days of the release date.  Instead they just never shipped the order.  They had plenty of stock, they just were not filling my order.  Very upsetting.  I cancelled the order since there is no way of contacting anyone at Amazon personally.  Emails bounce back telling you to read their policies.  It's ridiculous."
"I have had a bad experience with Amazon's subscribe and save, and I would strongly reccomend that it be avoided.  The scheme is somewhere between a dishonest bait and switch, and outright fraud.  I signed up for a monthly delivery at an attractive price, and after 3 months, the price doubled (way above market rate, with no notification other than the shipment confirmation, at which point it is too late to do anything about it.  I have soured on Amazon, and plan to avoid doing buisiness with them whenever possible."
"Amazon sucks! Most of their retailers won't ship outside the USA, and charge exhorbitant shipping costs. Also misleasding info with regard to items: ie, I ordered a second-hand copy of the libretto to Berlioz' 'Trojans'. It was advertised as 'Opera in five acts.' After skinning me $20 ($10 for a wafer thin booklet & $10 shipping!), I found the book included only the first three acts.I won't be shopping with Amazon again unless I can't avoid it."
"I thought ebay.com was the worst when it came to customer service? Well i was wrong Amazon.com is as bad, they will not guarantee your transaction with an individual seller.So if you get scammed you are on your own, so please don't think that your money is safe if shopping on Amazon.com because it's not.Once you have paid they wash their hands and as far as they are concerned the issue is between you and the seller.Buyer Beware!!!"
"Amazon marketplace seller ZTBBKS cancelled order after 48 hours:Hello, During the packaging of your order, I noticed it had some damage and was not in the condition it was listed as, so in order to spare you any further inconvenience, I have canceled the order and your account has not been charged.  I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused.  Thank you for your understanding, ZTBBKSNo other explanation or option was offered. Amazon should drop this seller."
"I purchased a high definition RGB cable from a third party retailer from through amazon.com. The cable I received did not allow for HD.I tried to contact the third party seller, no response. So I put in a A-to-z guarantee claim and was denied. I did not receive any reason as to why it was denied. I still have the cable...It just sits in the closet and is not being used because it's worthless."
"Sometimes you get what you pay for. I ordered a replacement screen for my model laptop which was close, but did not fix as well as the original. Now I can either pay out of my own pocket to return it or just deal with a screen that doesnt fit perfect in my laptop."
"I CANNOT stand Amazon.com Their prices aren't that great, their shipping sucks, if you buy directly from Amazon especially. They impose standards on the sellers on their website that they, themselves, don't live up to. They just suck.I don't know who makes the decisions for this website, but they are awful- dare I say evil. Do a search on Google for AMAZON, their reputation stinks. They kick off sellers that have been there forever, and open the door for startup sellers with no feedback, then kick them off too. I have gone back to buy from a seller I liked, and poof -gone. Everytime I buy something, I have to go find a new seller. This site has no loyalty to anybody. I am going back to eBay, which at least has sellers with established feedback that I can contact and put on my favorites list.Something is wrong with a website that cannot keep sellers around."
"My last order with Amazon.com was placed on December 16th, 2010 when I requested two books. As of January 27th, 2011 they have still not arrived, and all I have received is a lame excuse that the Postal Service is still having holiday delays. Worldofbooksusa, the company sponsored by Amazon to supply the books, obviously never had them in stock. Worldofbooksusa stated to me that the books were sent early this month.The ""Pony Express"" could deliver them faster than this!! I seriously doubt the books were ever sent and expect that I'll never see them!  "
"I'll keep this brief. If you every want to steal something, all you have to do is buy it from a seller who sells on amazon and then say the package came but the item was missing. Amazon always rules for the seller. They will simply refund your money and charge it back to the seller. Free Ipod! Free laptop! You name it--Free!I used to be a big amazon shopper and seller. I reviewed products, I bought, I sold, I used amazon Japan and amazon UK. I bought groceries on the subscribe and save program. I spent usually more than $5000 a month on my amazon credit card. I bought kindle books. Amazon was my go to place for everything I bought....Until...I sold my daughter's ipod on amazon and a new first time buyer said the package arrived empty, stole it, and told amazon she didn't get it. Amazon wouldn't look at our profiles. Me, a loyal amazon buyer and seller for a decade and her a new first time buyer. First time buyer because she probably kept stealing stuff and kept getting a new account.They was no reasoning with amazon in any way. They think most sellers will just lose the money to keep the privilege of continuing to sell. I just sold some of my personal items---and I had 100% positive feedback---but no more amazon for me! This happened around August 2010 and I haven't bought anything from those aholes since.I will tell everybody I know. I will blog it. I will post reviews like this on resellerratings. Amazon stole from me.On amazon I am clickme.clickme"
Last 4 orders were not delivered by the expected delivery time. I have ordered plenty from them in the past with no issues and was hoping the first 3 were flukes. Nope. I'm done with Amazon.
"I'm not very happy with Amazon's recent change on their shipping policy. I live in Alaska and have been shopping at Amazon.com for years. I just found out that they no longer do AmazonPrime to Alaska and shipping for a $7 optical mouse is about $10. My last order was shipped to here for free (I placed the order a week ago). I am very disappointed and furious about the fact that they they changed the policy without any explanations. Amazon.com is located in Seattle, WA and flights to Anchorage only takes 3.5 hours (compare that to a 5.5-hour flight from New York to Seattle). They ship to New York free for qualifying orders, but charge outrageous rates to Alaska. I did not mind it when they did not want to ship heavy equipments up here, but applying harsh shipping rates to light products and media seem unfair. This is a clear discrimination and needs a further explanation. Alaska is a US state and not a territory. I hope they are aware of that.  "
"I usually am very pleased with Amazon.com IF I am dealing directly with them. However, I am finding more and more that if I place an order that involves one of their partners, I'm taking a big risk. If problems develop, Amazon will forward on the complain but will not actively participate in resolving the problem. The first time I encountered a problem (which involved credit card fraud on the part of partner), I wrote the CEO of Amazon. Their response essentially stated that they had had good experience with the company and would not pursue my complaint.This time I ordered 13 boxes of Power Bars from Amazon's partner, bikesomewhere.com for over $150. Whereas the package arrived in a reasonable period of time, the 13 boxes inside were damaged to different degrees - enough so that I questioned the safety of the products. In fact, I checked the expiration dates on each box, suspecting they were way past their shelf life. Most of the boxes were not appropriately sealed, and you could see the bars in some of the boxes. The most damaged box had a bar missing, and end of the wrapper on the rest had been cut off - exposing the bars themselves! Clearly there is no quality control at this store, and I'm sure they are in violation of FDA rules.Amazon accepts no responsibility for these partner stores....You can only complete a complaint form online, and they forward the complaint to the offending store.From now on, I will only shop via Amazon itself. If the product goes through a partner store, I will not proceed.One of the questions in this survey was to rate my experience with Amazon's return policy. I gave it a ""poor"" rating because they are deferring to the partner store, and that store has yet to respond. I'd return the products if I could, but Amazon refuses to get involved, and bikesomewhere.com won't respond."
"This is my recent purchase experience with Amazon.com:If you're a shopper like me, then you must realize Amazon been advertising and making claim that if you order on a specific dates, you should receive your stuff by December 24th. I placed my order on the 18th with Free Super Saver Shipping (one day before the deadline for Free Super Saver Shipping to receive on the 24th). But it turned out my order just sitting and ""processing"" for almost 2 days until it leave the fulfillment center. When I made a complain to the Amazon Customer service, they said I should be receiving my stuff AFTER CHRISTMAS! How outrageous is that? On top of that, since my stuff is already in the ""processing"" phase, I can't cancel it. Up till this point Dec 24th, still haven't got an update on the Amazon tracking.On the contrary, my order on Black Friday was incredibly fast: placed it on Saturday and got it by the following Monday/Tuesday (also used Free Super Saver Shipping). It is questionable that Amazon actually cares about Black Friday than Christmas.Here's a warning for fellow shoppers: unless they offer Free Overnight Shipping, AVOID ANY RETAILERS CLAIMS ABOUT DELIVERING YOUR STUFFS TO YOU BY CHRISTMAS."
"I bought ""Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8 AT-X Pro DX Zoom Digital Lens + UV Filter + Cleaning Kit for Nikon D50, D70, D80, D90, D200, D300 & D300s Digital SLR Cameras"" on December 16, 2010, around 9 pm from Amazon.com but sold by Cameta Camera. About 1 hour later, I clicked on order summary and it said the package was ready to ship and couldn't be canceled or changed. I was really happy and hope either Amazon or Cemeta would have shipped my order on the next day.Unfortunately, the order from Amazon sold by Cameta didn't ship it on the day expected and I do need it before X'mas (12/24/10). Even worse, today (12/18/10) my order still hasn't been shipped yet!! I do wish Santa would give me a best gift before the X'mas is gone.****Update****My order was shipped on Dec 21, 2010, and will be delivered on Dec 28, 2010, based on UPS tracking information. Very dissapointed with process of shipping. 12/16/2010 - Place an order12/21/2010 - Shipped12/28/2010 - *** X'mas gone ***Nothing I can say but too long! For buyers, you need to have bunch of time if they said 3-5 days standard shipping or you might go for 1-3 days expedited shipping which is cost you double for fees. Sirot R."
Their TV low price guarantee is a joke. They refuse to honor it even I found a better price ON THEIR OWN web site. They only honor it when they lower THEIR OWN price. Buyers be aware. You most likely can find a lower price somewhere else.
"We are an FBA seller.  Amazon has merged items and ships the wrong products to our customers.  After learning of the error a week ago, and speaking with Amazon on a daily bases, we receive no resolution.  Asked if Amazon will compensate us for the cost incurred, Amazon has said that they will not.  Both the seller and the customer experience suffers.  As a large corporation, Amazon is able to dictate unreasonable terms.  Buyers should shop elsewhere so that this does not become the norm."
"Amazon pricing policies suck. I bought iPod Touch from them during their Black Friday sale just to find out that two weeks later they lowered the price by $15. I tried contacting their customer support reps, but they were rude and unhelpful. I've been their local customer since 1996. I guess now that Amazon ran most B&M; stores out of business they can start treating their customers like crap. How are they better than Walmart? At least Walmart will give you a price adjustment withing 90 days. Their customer service is in India and all the people I spoke to are idiots."
"I ordered one model of Bonjour Primo Latte and got a later version of this model, which does not froth milk and does not work.  Online reviews had alerted me to this problem, and I patiently waited while this vendor promised to fill my order in due course.  Unfortunately, the frother which I receive is not what I ordered, and does not work.  It is useless.  The company offered to refund the cost of my order, but not the postage.  I agreed, to get this problem behind me, but I am not happy.  This is not a good outcome.  I have a useless frother, and still have paid shipping costs that have not been refunded.  I'm not willing to fight this further- but if someone wants to take the time to pick up this useless frother, I'd be glad to deliver it, and to ask for my money back, in full.  I waited for 2-3 months, after first being told the item was on back order-- this was not a good outcome."
"This review is specifically for Amazonwireless.com. This site is extremely unhelpful. We have made two separate orders for the Samsung Captivate, which they offer for $.01. Each time the order has been canceled due to some problem. The first problem was that AmazonWireless claimed AT&T; would not port our old phone number. This was not true. We called AT&T; and they said this would be no problem. However, because AmazonWireless automatically canceled our order we had to re-order the next day and due to 'high demand' the phone we wanted was now on backorder. The second order was automatically canceled due to a problem with driver's license information. Just canceled. No explanation beyond that. I will not be placing a 3rd order with AmazonWireless."
"I do not know why Amazon would do business with a company like ACE PHOTO DIGITAL that advertises products they don’t have in inventory. I will make sure that I let everyone know and warn them about the unprofessional companies that Amazon has under its umbrella.  What pisses me of worst is that ACE PHOTO DIGITAL actually sent me an email telling me that they had shippped the package. When I spoke to a service repre, who was rude and condescending, she admitted that the product was in fact SOLD OUT. I have never ever experienced this with EBAY. BTW I can get the same product on EBAY for half the cost.  "
I ordered an electronic item from Amazon (as seller) for $45. A few days later I got an e-mail saying my order was cancelled because the item was not available. I looked on their website and the item was available for $85. I emailed them to try to get them to honor the original price to no avail. I will not be ordering from Amazon any more. The same items can be found at the same or lower price without sales tax in some cases. 
"I have purchase items from amazon from time to time with ok results, the last time I tried to place and order there was an issue withe credit card, I tried to go to my account to see if there was an error with the number but I could not see the number except the last 4. So I could not check or correct it. They kept sending automated emails that there was a problem. I sent four emails to them explaining what was going on. I told them that we needed to have a human intervene so we could fix the problem. I gave them my phone number yet I never got person to respond. The order was finally canceled by them. Now we are through doing business as I can not fix the card issue."
"WORST SELLER SUPPORT EVER!!! I've been waiting for more than a month for the review of my account, but after one month, I received an email telling me that my account was suspended with NO REASON, they ask me to answer the same questions that I answered one month ago and let me wait for another month.NEVER SELL ON AMAZON, THEY HAVE THE WORST SELLER SUPPORT EVER!!!!"
"I have shopped at Amazon before, and while the experience was never excellent - before today at least it wasn't horrible. Amazon was the place I'd shop when the slight savings made up for having to wait over a week to receive the order; any other time it wasn't worth it.This time, I should have suspected that the order would be botched when at checkout I was offered a month's free trial of Amazon Prime. I decided to give it a try, at each stage of the sign-up process the text made it clear that this was a free trial and I would not be charged until it expired. After I had clicked the final acceptance button, I was informed that my card had been charged $70+ and that my Prime subscription would expire in a year. I of course canceled it on the spot, but unfortunately my card had been charged and it would take several days to get the money back.I decided to place the order anyway. Before placing the order I made sure that even with the slow free shipping it would arrive before Thanksgiving as it was meant to be a gift for a family member that was flying in for just one day. Once Amazon posted the tracking info, I saw that it was scheduled to be delivered the day before Thanksgiving (Wednesday) - perfect. When I checked the tracking on Tuesday, I saw that it was listed as out for delivery - in KENT WA while I live in SPOKANE WA. I at first though that it may be a typo, but a little after noon I saw that the tracking status had been changed to incorrect address. I have shopped at Amazon for many years and have not changed my address for over 3 years - during this time I have always received my orders at this address, I did not change it at checkout.Needless to say, I am extremely unhappy with Amazon's handling of the order. First the fiasco with the Amazon Prime ""free trial"" then the botched order. I am now out the gift that I needed to have by Thanksgiving and have no other option as the item is not available locally. This will be the last time I place an order with Amazon. The marginal savings are not worth the slow service, shipping, and headaches. The complete lack of customer service is just unacceptable.**UPDATE**Received a reply from Amazon, the order was returned as undeliverable and if I want it I need to place a new order. Unacceptable."
"Amazon.com shows 2 Asoka PlugLink 9650 85Mbps HomePlug Powerline Ethernet Adapters for the price $25 sold by Quality.Direct. I only received 1 unit not the pair and it won't work if it is not a pair. I called both Amazon and Quality.Direct asked for the full refund with a free shipping back, but end up only got $19 back plus I have to pay for the shipping back. It makes me so unhappy and don't understand why they want to mislead us by showing a pair there, and only sent 1 unit then, when I returned it, they also charge me $6 for the restock, even though the one I received was a used one without any original package on it only wrapped by paper. I don't trust them now. "
"I ordered the electric heater because they promised to deliver it in 5 business days. They did not send the item the next day, as promised. I contacted Customer Services. They refused to cancel the order, refused to tell when the item will be shipped and when it will be delivered. Now, two days later, I have new estimate: the item will be delivered not in 5 business days, as they promised, but in 10 business days. Needless to say, I would never pay to wait for the heater for 2 weeks. After they took the money, they do as they please. The company is dishonest, and proud of it. "
"I tried purchasing my appliances from Amazon, what a mess.  Amazon is a resller of other stuff and appliances are not good to get from the man with no face.  Try calling about customer service issues and ugh, problems."
"I ordered a surveillance camera through Amazon and they sent the order to Atlanta Network Technologies.  Then the trouble started.  I asked Amazon for help, they refused to help me.  Kept referring me back to ANTOnline, and that was useless too.  Got nowhere.  I have been robbed.  They have my money, I have NO camera."
"I just canceled my order for items that were listed as in-stock.  The order was placed on Sunday...now after 5 days (4 business days) they still have not shipped and even worse, the estimate to ship was a month from now.  This is the second delayed order from Amazon (I waited on the other one to eventually ship), but not this time.  The order was to be fulfilled by Amazon LLC, not a third party.  So, my business is headed to other companies that ship in a timely fashion on the products the have on their website.  Listing products as available but not being able to fulfill them in a timely fashion is a reason for me to look elsewhere. "
"I had ordered a few things before without problem and had signed up for prime membership that was before I bought a costume for Halloween.  When I made the selection of costume amazon.com wouldn't admit it was in stock until you selected color and size and my pick happened to be in stock.  Being a prime member I qualified for free 2 day shipping. I had purchased 2 items in the same order one arrived on my door in 2 days very quickly. A few days later I wondered where my costume was. I logged on to find out and the estimated delivery was Nov 17-30 more than 30 days after my order.  I emailed Amazon and their reply was that if its not in stock at the nearest supplier it can take up to 5 days to ship the item, and packaging can also take 24 hours. Which is fine I gave them 10 days to get the item to my door.  In that very email they estimated Nov 17-30th completely ignoring their own math. When I called them up the representative admitted I would get it quicker by going directly to the retailer.  So the item wasn't really in stock, they lied. They sent me an email with an excuse on why it takes up to 6 days and then in the same email estimate 30 days. I canceled my prime membership and decided to let others know that you may qualify for 2 day shipping but they wont ship it for a month."
I guess I was at fault....so I ordered a package deal TV and 3D Glasses and Gift Card....I order...Tv arrives 1 day late take the day off from work to get it no biggie...But no glasses or card...ok call customer sevice and get told because I didn't add the items to the cart Im S.O.L...Ok my bad I didn't click on the link that explained that and didn't realize I had to add them hence package deal??? so anyways I get told I wont be getting them so Im out 450???yup so I said Ill be sending it back and closing my charge account I just open with you guys and never shop there again. So I go to the Competitors site....and look add to cart AND IT ADDS EVERYTHING YOU NEED...what an idea..so I ordered it from them a little cheaper to. Was it my fault I didn't read  the fine print sure...but really you guys couldn't just ship me the stuff I paid for..Worse online experince EVER
"I placed an order back on AUGUST 10TH for an ASUS GTX460 TOP Edition. I can't write a review about this card because I don't have it. The MSRP at the time of order was 199.99 and they had it listed for 209.99 on Amazon. My original ship date was supposed to be the end of August, but due to delays it was pushed back to mid September. I spoke with customer service and they checked their records. He told me it wouldn’t be delivered until October and was nice enough to upgrade my shipping speed. At the time of speaking with him Amazon, LLC had it listed for 229.99 as it went up in price.Today I receive an email cancelling my order saying the site had an incorrect price. The first representative never said anything about an incorrect price or indicated that they wouldn’t sell it to me for that price. Now the card is over priced at 255.99 on AMAZON and now they won’t honor the price they listed. I could have placed an order from another site for a few dollars more and had the card in 3 DAYS. I have waited almost 2 months for this order only to see it cancelled. The nice woman I spoke with couldn’t even transfer me to higher authority, all she said was sorry about this.If you make a purchase in a ""brick and mortar"" store and a product is marked at the incorrect price you typically have to honor that price. I wouldn’t even be typing this review if this was handled professionally. YOU MADE ME WAIT FOR 2 MONTHS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I seriously hope enough people complain to bring this to light. This is not how to do business as I am certain your company president would agree. The person behind this decision does not have experience with the public nor understands a single thing about retail. It’s not as if the product was grossly underpriced as the original MSRP was less than 200 dollars. I just cancelled another order and my next 3 orders are going else where until this is resolved."
"Any game I order from them is extremely late despite the shipping I pay for, every book I order from them arrives damaged, and every seller is a hit or miss with my biggest problem being false advertising (they will say a book is new yet when it arrives it has markings, scuffs, etc all over it)."
"Their customer service personnel is unprepared to help.  They cannot answer easy questions about their own site (settings, message notifications, etc).  Training on how to respond to customers will help them be better."
  Amazon sent me wrong item. They paid return shipping and sent the correct item but it was too late!! Will shop again however!
"Amazon.com has the worst customer service. no phone numbers to the complaints department. When you get them to call you, they can't help you. "
"Experienced a problem with my order. Ontrac is carrier and says they made delivery attempt but did not (I was sitting here waiting all day). Amazon ""can't get ahold of anyone there"". I spent an hour on the phone with Amazon with NO help at all. Then finally called ontrac and they answered first ring ... however, they were unable to explain what happened. My main problem with Amazon is that you cannot talk to anyone in the United States. I literally spent 30 minutes on the phone with a manager who was unable to give me ANY WAY to talk to someone in the United States. I literally hate amazon now. I refuse to give any more of my money to a company where I can't even talk to someone via phone, email, or any other method that is in the United States. I'm shopping local from now on."
"When I ordered the camera (canon eos t2i with nice lenses for more than $1100), the item was in stock, and I bought this item as a birthday gift. In fact, when I ordered, they asked me if I want any accessories. Then , I bought a lot of accessories. Then, the accessories have arrived, but I am still waiting for the camera. They are saying that it is out of stock. Don't trust these guys! Stay away from them! I could buy the item for $30 more at the same time, but i trusted these guys, and right now there is no nice price like that. If you are out of stock, why are you lying! They have done this to me twice. I shouldn't have trusted them, and go for a little more from a different store. be careful, they are doing this kind of problems always!"
"I had a promotional credit that was given from a prior purchase.  I attempted to use this credit on items that I did want to purchase, trying to purchase items that were fulfilled by amazon, or sold via amazon through warehouse deals.  When attempting to do so, the option to use the promotional credit was not given and I was forced to purchase something I didn't want in order to not completely lose the credit.  due to amazon.com's refusal to allow me to use the credit on items that were fulfilled by amazon.com, or through amazon.com's warehouse deals page, this will be the last time I purchase something that comes with a promotional credit, as I cannot trust that I will be allowed to use the credit on something that I would want while still following the promotional credit guidelines"
"I originally bought a TV on July 22nd. When I purchased the TV, the earliest Amazon Prime ""Scheduled Delivery"" shipping date was August 11th, so I switched to Standard Shipping, which Amazon said would cause the TV to ship out the next day. However, that didn't happen. Instead, a few days later I got an email stating that I would not get the item until mid-August. I emailed Amazon to find out why there was such a major change in the delivery date since the TV was shown as in stock when I purchased it and was in stock for at least a little while longer after my purchase. The person responding to the email treated me like an idiot who didn't understand how to read shipping dates (although in a polite tone) and basically just confirmed that my delivery date had been pushed back. When I then called Amazon to find out what was going on the person on the phone didn't seem to know that my delivery date was pushed back and continued to tell me that my delivery date was in mid-August. When I informed him that my delivery date had changed, he apologized and could only tell me that the ""availability had changed."" In the end I received no reason for why my delivery date was pushed back so far and have found out that many people who ordered this TV at the same time as me have already received theirs.I am very disappointed with Amazon and if the TV hadn't been such a good deal I would have canceled already. At the very least I think I should of been informed about the delay much sooner, not a few days after the purchase. Considering that I will not even be home if the the delivery date is later than the posted expected date I may be forced to refuse the package anyway.To Amazon's credit the person on the phone was very polite, although not very helpful."
"They have to do a better job of inventory control, I ordered a SLR camera package, marked in-stock than they started to slide the delivery time , again and again until I lost the $200 rebate form the camera.Customer service is useless..I once ordered an item, in-stock, never shipped it, than cancelled it after about 1.5-years!!!!!!"
"Have bought from them for years. But the first time I needed Customer Service, I got a Canned response which had nothing to do with my question. Also, fist time I wrote a Negative Comment about a product, they never posted it!! I tried again a few days later, and again it did not show up! And I did not use any obscenity."
I purchased a wine cellar from Target through their Amazon store. First they delivered the wrong item. It then took them two weeks to send the right item. When it arrived it was all beat to hell. I don't know if it was the shipper or if Target ships damaged items. Trying to resolve this with Amazon they just said they would give me a refund and didn't even bother trying to offer a replacement. Now four weeks later I am back where I started.
"Terrible long shipping time when you choose free shipping (sales above $25). Ordered June 30th and estimated arrival is July 12th. This is just from Kentucky to Missouri! Tracking is useless, does not tell you where item is at, just scan times.At this day and age, getting an item 1/2 month after ordering is unacceptable. Disappointing!"
"I ordered this TV but it never arrived. The tracking number provided by CEVA, the shipper that Amazon hired, never worked and I was never able to tell where the TV was. I contacted Amazon to ask what happened to the TV and after a long wait, they said the TV was found and that it would arrive shortly. It never did, so I wrote again to cancel the order. But now Amazon refuses to refund me until they get the TV back - as if they hold me responsible . I found out some very interesting things about Amazon since this began: 1) It takes 1 or 2 days for Amazon to get back to you now. Thats just horrible customer support. 2) Amazon said they talked to CEVA, their shipping company, ""on my behalf"" - as if this was a problem between me and CEVA and that Amazon had nothing to do with it. I am not CEVA's customer. Amazon hired them. This is a problem between Amazon and CEVA. All I did was place an order in good faith. 3) And finally, Amazon tells me they arent going to refund me until they get the TV back. They are punishing me because they hired the wrong shipper! What if CEVA has lost it, does that mean I dont get my money back? What if it takes CEVA a month to return it, will I have to wait that long? I have purchased several thousand dollars worth of goods from Amazon, and I cannot believe they would treat me in this way. I can tell you one thing for sure - but I will NEVER buy from them again. "
"Not happy with Amazon today:1. SuperSaver penalty: Amazon offers SuperSaver shipping on orders over $25.00. Compared to 3-5 day delivery time for standard shipping, SuperSaver orders should arrive within 5-9 days. No so. I ordered a bike repair stand on July 6. With SuperSaver, the _shipping_ date would have been July 12, whereas for standard shipping the _delivery_ date would have been July 12. In other words, delivery of an in-stock item was going to take 11-17 days, not 5-9.2. Problems changing an order: I decided to pay for shipping. To find out what the costs would be,  I first changed the order to two day shipping. But then I couldn't change to Standard or cancel. Apparently when you click two day shipping, the order is immediately in ""process"" and can't be changed on the web. After some time exploring  the Customer Service screens, I discovered a ""Call Me Back"" option, entered my phone number, and was called within five minutes (good!). Luckily the rep was able to change the order, but I was so fed up at that point that I told her to cancel it.3. Rebate switch: I had applied for an Amazon Visa to get a $40.00 rebate on my next purchase. After a while, I decided to re-order the item. Imagine my surprise when the advertised rebate for using the new Visa card was $30.00, not $40.00. I logged out, deleted cookies, and the next time I logged in, the rebate was up to $40.00 again. Amazon's been caught before raising prices for people who looked at an item once, then came back to order later. This looks like more of the same."
"No complaint about Amazon as a buyer, but from a seller's perspective they have been particularly unhelpful by issuing refunds to buyers who refuse to return merchandise. Amazon is in the best position to help achieve a resolution, since individual sellers have little leverage to demand a return, especially when an out-of-state buyer in involved. Although it pains me to say this, Amazon pales next to eBay/PayPal's more equitable claim resolution. BBB intervention was useless, so let the seller beware."
Avoid amazon has bad service
"Amazon.com continues, despite numerous complaints and telephone calls, to allow 3rd party sellers to list their items in better conditions than they are and they will not do anything to help the victims. There are good sellers on Amazon, but Amazon is as guilty of fraud as the seller when - they are told of a listing blatantly illustrating abuse of conditions and they do absolutely nothing except patronize me."
2 store  fronts Lexerd(PA) and Charger City order number 105-3399786-4363440.I have not recieved either of these orders.I have tried to contact these store fronts either by phone or email. no response.
"I had tried ordering a tablet PC through amazon.com and had shipped it to a different address than the billing address. Well they ended up stopping the order for security reasons which i can understand. After that i told them that i authorized that order and that i paid for 1 day shipping for which they said it would be there tomorrow. Well it turns out i couldn't get in contact with anyone that would give me an answer about my tablet PC. They forwarded all my inquiries to a so-called ""account specialist"" that they said would speak to me within 24 hours. They did not return a call once and i had no word about my tablet PC order being canceled until a day later. One of the technicians even hung up on me while i was waiting! This is the worst customer service i have ever received anywhere and i would tell everyone i know not to shop at amazon. Their price on the site may be cheaper but you're either not going to get the order through or you'll have to deal with 48 hours worth of hassle. do NOT shop  here!"
"I purchased some paintings from Amazon over a month ago and I am yet to receive them. The seller is not responding and Amazon is no help. I have emailed several times asking them to assist me, but there has been nothing but automated replies. In the mean time, the seller still continues to scam other people like myself by selling his stuff on Amazon."
"Poor experience.  Amazon's web site is becoming increasingly difficult to use, to figure out if I am ordering from them, or some so-so merchant listed on there.  Who knows on this order, but the delivery was very SLOW.  Ordered March 6th, and March 11th it finally shipped. I did not receive the items (just two DVDs) until March 17th.   11 Days is slow.   I thought Amazon would be fast at books and DVDs"
I bought NEW Citizen Nighthawk watch from Amazon. The item I received was NOT A NEW ITEM. The watch I received appeared to be used. Cylindrical box and warranty booklet were stained. No nylon film on the watch dial and bracelet. And most disappointing the bracelet clasp was all scratched. I am very disappointed with Amazon. As a consumer when I buy a new item I expect it to be REALLY NEW. And if they sell used watches they need to state USED instead of NEW in the item description.
"I had a very poor experience with this order.  First of all, the order did not arrive.  I contacted both Amazon.com and the affiliate (OrangeOnions) and received no responses.  I waited another week and contacted them both again, still no response.  I did not receive a response until I was given the opportunity to rate the transaction...which I rated accordingly.  It was then that the affiliate contacted me and tried to bribe me with a $15 coupon to redact my review.  The $15 did not even come close to making up for the $70 I lost not receiving the order.  It was more of an insult.  I wish I could have rated them again because they would have gotten another bad review."
"I have been an Amazon customer since 1996. I never had a problem until I used the services of one of their ""sellers""  to buy some items. The items never showed up the seller told me to fill my bodily orifices with objects of a disgusting nature and Amazon reneged on their A to Z guarantee on me claiming my country was not supported when if fact it was listed right there in the list of supported countries they provided in their email. Tried to escalate my complaint believing it to be an obvious error but they (AMAZON) never replied to my queries. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM  AMAZON MARKETPLACE. Stay with books or be burned..."
Purchased a coffee table from them and it arrived 4 weeks later and it was damaged. The seller refused to take it back saying that I did not purchase insurance for it. So now I am out $500 and I have no table. They also refused to reimburse or help me with getting it repaired. Amazon is good for books but not for coffee tables apparently.
"I ordered a Canon T1i from Amazon over 6 weeks ago. They were out of stock, but notified me within a week that they had them in stock and gave me a shipping estimate a month away. I received no further updates, so I emailed them a week ago and received a notice that there was some delay and they were postponing the estimate. Today, I get a notice that they expect further delay and I need to confirm if I want to continue to wait or cancel my order and order from somewhere else. The problem is, the price for this camera has gone up $150 in the past 6 weeks. I go to confirm my order (which the email says I must do before March 10 or else the order will be canceled) my order is missing. I have no outstanding orders with Amazon. So now, I have no camera and they have canceled my order and I am faced with having to pay $150 more for the same camera. I bought all the accessories for this camera when I placed the order for the camera. Those are all here, but of no use. Terrible experience with lots of stress thus far. "
"Amazon double shipped this order, I sent one back at my cost, they gave me credit for less than half of my cost.  They did not tell me they would give me credit for less than half my cost before I sent the merchandise back.  I will not order from them again."
"I bought a Pentax lens, Amazon charged my account for $212.94, and then they sent me an email telling me they no longer have the lens. I can only hope that they will return the money in a week or so. This has happened many times before. Books are OK on Amazon, but anything else, they try to screw you as much as they can get away with. Yes, they have the lens now, but they are charging about 10 dollars more for it."
"I placed an order for this book, and since I read the reviews from other buyers I called and verified to make sure I am going to get both volumes, but They only sent me the first volume and when I called they said return the book and order again or we can give you a 50% discount and you can purchase the second volume elsewhere. "
"I bought a Refurbished Nuvi 500 sold directly by Amazon on Nov 24 for a Xmas gift for $133.  On Dec 25 (yes Xmas day and over a month later) they cancelled my order claiming they could not get it any longer.  Their resellers on Amazon were still selling the Refurbished units for $209, but Amazon kept denying that they could fulfill the order from them.  Three weeks later, the refurbished unit from that reseller is being directly fulfilled by Amazon.  They straight out lied to me and the BBB.  Amazon has extremely poor and untrustworthy practices.  As I had already promised it on Xmas day, I had to buy one at full price.  Needless to say, I will not trust Amazon ever again.  Shop at your own risk.The icing on the cake is that their customer service is really bad as well, they kept avoiding my complaint and instead replied to items I had not even requested or complained about; completely useless.  At one point they replied that they did a search on ""Garmin"" but could not find any products; but if you try you will see that literally hundreds of products come up (and that is not even the correct search in the first place, they should have read the e-mail before answering) --> shows you that they never even tried, just copied bits and pieces from the e-mail and stone wall everything.Reading other reviews here, it seems to be fairly common ... if anything goes wrong; good luck having them to the right thing!"
"The estimated delivery date passed, which is one month after my order.  I haven't received the book.  I checked my Amazon account and didn't even find my order.  I contacted Amazon by email and it turns out that I have 2 accounts.  I must have screwed up while trying to update my account.  So, I was asked to send them a new password and they would fix it.  The only thing that changed was my password, yet no order shows in my account.  I emailed them again and asked them to delete/ close any other account, because it must have been a mistake (of mine)and I just want 1 account.I received an email back asking me to follow the exact same steps to change my password I did that very same day again.What's wrong with these folks? I don't want to change my password (again)!  HELLOOOO!!!  Just read the emails I send.They ask you not to return any emails but to follow up on a link.  That's where it goes through too many hands without a history, since there is no email string.  What a hassle.Oh, I should have mentioned that they did tell me the first time that if I haven't received my book by Feb 15 (ANOTHER MONTH LATER) they would send anotherone out.  Since it's the second book of a trilogy, I should start reading the first book again, because I don't think I remember anything 'til the second part arrived.  Luckily, I already found the 3rd part here."
"Worst Experience doing business with Amazon. I bought a 46 inch Samsung LCD TV ln46b630 from Amazon for $1000. Was very excited about the TV. TV was damaged in transit by the carrier. Called Amazon expecting that they would replace the TV and send it to me by expedite shipping. Boy, was I wrong!!Amazon customer service rep told me that they don't have this TV in stock anymore. This TV is now selling for $1250 at other stores. They asked me to buy another TV from Amazon but they only have inferior TVs for $1000 compared to the one I bought. They asked me to buy an inferior TV for the same cost or more for no fault of mine. The cust service rep told me that it is not a perfect world and all that bull-crap. They cannot do much about it and that things happen blah blah..This was the worst experience ever and I am not going to do business with Amazon EVER!!The cust ser rep also ridiculed and mocked my suggestion of Amazon or their appointed carrier to pay the difference in price at which I bought the TV and what it is currently at the other stores. Very Very Unprofessional."
I had a poor reseller experience on Amazon.com. Beware of resellers in Amazon's Marketplace. 
"Amazon offered Panasonic 50"" TV for $999.99 and get free Blue Ray Disk Player.  It was ordered Nov. 21, 2009. They separated the order, charged me for the Player and still have not sent the TV.  What a bait and switch. They keep putting off delivery latest date is Jan. 31, 2010.  Beware when they offer items like this.  I now have a player but no TV to use it with.  It has gone beyond the return date so I have been forced to pay for an item I was to get free when I tried to purchase the TV. The TV is what I wanted when ordering, the player offer was not important.  Shame on Amazon taking orders for items they apparently never had.Never thought they would stoop so low using this bait and switch method."
"Amazon sellers often have prices that are hard to beat.  What they don't tell you is if you have a problem with one of their sellers, the BUYER pays for all mistakes even if the selleris the one who screws up.  I bought a keyboard from one of their sellers and they sentme the wrong one.  They didn't even have the one they were advertising. Amazon requiresthe BUYER to pay for return shipping even if the seller was at fault for sending the wrong item. The person who made the mistake is supposed to be the one who pays!  Amazon needs to step in to the real world with their return policies. Don't buy anything from PRSurplus."
"I ordered an item that was stocked and sold by Amazon for a pre-Christmas delivery. The item did not come in time for Christmas, despite Amazon's estimate that it would. I am disappointed and will be weary of Amazon's promises the next time. True, it is probably the fault of USPS, but Amazon should say that delivery times with USPS cannot be depended on, when they cleary cannot. "
"Amazon's website listed an item I intended to buy as a Christmas present for my son. Amazon listed the item as available and in-stock. The price was acceptable so I made the purchase and got the confirmation email within minutes. The next day I received another email stating that my order was canceled because the item was not available. The email advised me to search Amazon's website for the item again and re-order! What for, so they can lie to me again and say it's available when it isn't? I went to another website and found the same item for $25 LESS! I didn't think it was physically possible, but Amazon both SUCKS and BLOWS! If Amazon thinks I'll shop there again, they'd better check the temperature in hell first!P.S. I just read some other posts here about Amazon refusing to update in-stock/available data on their website when the supplier clearly tells Amazon that an item is no longer available and the end result is customers having their orders canceled. I urge all online shoppers not to tolerate further incompetence from Amazon. Save yourself a headache. Amazon clearly has no respect for it's customers. Place your orders & sell your products elsewhere."
"Amazon used to be the first store I shopped at but no more! I ordered a computer program from them and TWO DAYS later the price was reduced by $18.50. I hadn't even received it, so I called them and requested a refund for the difference so that I could get the better price. They refused me stating that in order for me to get a refund for the difference, It would have to be for $20 or more! I couldn't believe what I was hearing so I asked to speak to a manager. He told me the same thing!! When the Postal service tried to drop off the package, I refused delivery. I then went online and ordered it again at the sale price, saving myself $18.50!!! If they had just given it to me for the reduced price, they wouldn't have had to pay to ship the first one back to themselves. Amazon USED to care about it's customers, but in my opinion, that's a thing of the past."
"I am posting this email because I am so disgusted with Amazon's Customer Service and I want everyone to know how terribly the handled my business.Dear Amazon,I am not emailing looking for an answer to my complaints because I received one yesterday by phone, I am emailing because I am so disappointed with your service and I wanted you to know how disappointing it is that you do this to your customers. I am a “here and there” shopper, if I see an item listed for a good price, I’ll buy it. However, since it is the holidays and I am a college student, I need some cash for Christmas Shopping. I have a ton of DVD’s stacked up in my room so I figure, listing them on Amazon can’t do any harm, so I set up a seller account and list them on your website. I figure if they are selling for say $3.00, I will list them at $2.99, and so on. I did not think that they were going to sell at all so I had no expectations going into it. Then, almost instantly, my inbox was flooded with emails saying that some of my DVD’s were sold. I was so happy and instantly bought shipping accessories and packaged them and shipped them off to their destinations, I even made sure each DVD had a tracking number so as to satisfy the customer 100% and I would know when the packages got to their destinations safely. I was so happy that everything was selling and I was getting extra cash, but the shipping charges were very expensive, overall I probably spent $65.00 on shipping in a 3-day period. However, since the buyer pays for shipping and Amazon reimburses me, I figure that’s ok. Then, I go to look at my balance when this is all done, I am expecting about $120.00 profit, and I see that my balance, including shipping, is $112.00. I was shocked, I couldn’t believe that it was so low. Then I saw the Amazon fees, I was being charged up to $3.00 for a DVD that only sold for roughly $2 or $3! I figured that there must be some kind of mistake, so I called and talked to customer service. They explained to me that all of the fees were disclosed, and I made my mistake in not realizing that the prices that Amazon lists for the DVD’s selling price is including shipping. Also Amazon charges a 15% Commission Fee even though I was selling DVD’s as low as 80 cents. Well this is what I have to say to Amazon, that was a shady process. I imagine that tons of people a day make the same mistake that I do, and Amazon told me that if I list anything under or around $3, I will be losing money. If you were a great website that cared about your customers and not just about the customers who sell over 40 items in a month and do not get charged the 99 cent listing fee, you would give a warning right away to any customer who is listing anything for under $3.00. I am positive that no one on the site would list anything so low if they knew they were going to lose money. You can imagine how upset I was when I was not warned about this before, and told when it was too late, not only that, but Amazon could not do anything to help me. I am disgusted with the way Amazon handles business with customers like me, and never again will I make the mistake of listing my products on Amazon, whether it is under $3.00 or not, because Amazon does not care about its customers. I will make sure to spread the word on websites where customers look before posting items so that they do not make the same mistake that I did, you can be sure of that. One minute I am so grateful to Amazon because I am thinking that I will have over $100 in my pocket so that I can buy presents for my family, and then the next I am told that Amazon took half of that in “fees”. It really is the biggest disappointment you can give to a customer. As I said, I am not looking for any answers from you, I am simply letting you know that you get a 0% for customer service in my book and others will be informed so that no one will lose money to your website because you charge absurd fees for items that are only $1.00.Sincerely,A College StudentNo Longer an Amazon Customer"
"They were misled information about the no interest for 12 months, and I end up have to pay the interest. Their customer service department is most the time I can barely understand. I purchased the camera Nikon D3X, priced $7500.00 and their customer service representative told me, yes my amazon.com (chase) credit card would apply for this camera with 12 months no interest. A month later I received the Chase Credit Card statement said I do not have 0% interest for this purchase. I called amazon's  reprentative and they said they are sorry and wouldn't help any further.

"Jesus Christ! I'll not order from this notied online store again!I ordered one VN 6200 PC pocket digital recorder from amazon.com but received two. After a prolonged argument with its customer service department amazon.com still insisted that I made my mistake not theirs. My argument was that if I made the mistake, then why did I make the orders twice at the same time but from two different venders that were affiliated with amazon.com?The argument last for a hour without any positive result. amazon.com even refused to help me to return one of the recorders back so my conclusion from this experience is that amazon.com never acknowledges mistake and refuses to provide help. When numerous online stores and physical stores are available today why do I go to amazon.com for shopping? It was because its reputation, right? But once you experienced the above, does this store still have any reputation left in your mind?????"
"I purchased a Callaway FT9iq driver at 275.49 on 3/22/09. Shipping was a bit slow but thats not the problem. I had a minor mishap with the club in June and returned the club to Callaway. I was informed that the club was counterfeit and warned against playing with same. After many phone calls Amazons last e-mail from Amazon indicated to make a claim against my credit card company in that they would not cover replacement or refund. (Amazon will respond only by e-mail) This was dated 11/09/09.It took Amazon from late June till November 9, 2009 to tell me they will not do anything. Don't do business with Amazon.com."
"Ordered a iPod Touch 8gb.  Came wrapped with only two air bags and was rattling around in the box. Was ordered for a birthday present and arrived 10 days prior. Fine...they would send another. They didn't send it priority mail and it arrived the day after the birthday party.  Cheap of them to save a few cents with priorty mail doesn't cost more than a few pennies more. The replacement arrived with more air bags and two were deflated and the iPod was able to move around in the box.  I have ordered a lot from Amazon, but I will never again order any electronics.  They have gone down hill.   "
"Ordered a Hard Drive as a gift. fourteen days after it was shopped & billed, still no delivery. Called today and got an off shore female with a terible accent. Nice person, but unable to speak understandable English. Bummer. I am unsure as to the outcome of the conversation, they may reship the item. I need a dose of patience."
"I placed an order of almost $84 for some video games for my son for Christmas.  Unfortunately, the way Amazon.com shipped them was inadequate.  They put them in a package that wasn't sealed at all on the sides (not a box, more like an envelope with carboard sides).  It wasn't taped and when the package arrived via USPS, the games were falling out of the package.  My son got the mail and was able to see everything in the package ruining the Christmas surprise.  To me, I'm now out $84 that I spent towards surprising my son on Christmas morning.  When I called Amazon, they wanted me to ship the items back to them so they could re-send them back to me.  When I asked what sense that made, the person I spoke with, (who had what appeared to be such a thick Indian accent that I couldn't understand her at times) offered me a $5 promo code and an apology.  Not good enough for me losing out on $84 worth of Christmas gifts that were supposed to be a surprise.  "
"Amazon is unfortunately one of those stores that the more you know about them, the less you want to do business. Like Walmart. You read stories posted all over the web on how they are ripping people off and generally being a pain.Here is my story.I sold my first item the other day. The customer paid $5.50 for it. I made less than 50c out of the deal. I shipped it for $2.48, which is under the $2.98 shipping credit I got. But Amazon reached their grubby hand in and swiped my entire profits, so I was left with the leftover shipping credit. A few days later I went to buy an item from Amazon, and had no money. I found my buyer and seller account are separate parts. Fine, I thought, I'll redeem my measly few dollars for a gift card. But nope, you can't. The only way you can get money is by giving them your checking account number.Combine these inconveniences with the fact that their cookies are pretty fishy and often suspected of spying, and the other little things, it's hard to have a good opinion of them. Everything I learn and everytime I use it I like Amazon less."
"I refuse to do business with Amazon.com again. Amazon used to be good, but now they ship all of their customer service jobs OVERSEAS to people who can hardly speak English. Also, Amazon intentionally misleads customers regarding shipping times. I paid extra for expedited shipping, and products I ordered from other sites after the Amazon order, for which I opted for regular shipping all arrived sooner than my Amazon order, and they were from the opposite side of the country. The Amazon order was from the same state. When I called I was told by idiot # 1, and idiot # 1's supervisor: ""I'm very sorry you feel that way sir, but that is our policy."" It sounded as if they were reading from a Xerox copy, because they BOTH said almost the same things word for word as the other did.It is clear to me that Amazon.com believes they are invincible. They are WRONG!From now on, if I find a product on Amazon.com that I want to buy, I will go directly to the seller's website, and then only after I check with Reseller Ratings first."
Delayed shipping - absolutely disappointing!!I ordered 2 products 3 days ago that said they were in stock. Because I chose the Free Super Saver shipping method the products don't go out for shipping immediately but rather 5-9 days after I submitted my order. This makes me think that Amazon.com tries to delay the free shipping so that customers are discouraged from using it. I will from now on use the free shipping offers that I get from Ebay. I have bought a lot of items on Amazon.com over the last years but after being a customer for 9 years I will now abandon this place!
"Have heard good things about this store but unfortunately had a very bad experience with them ordering a Samsung TV. Ordered the TV as a birthday present with plenty of time to spare as it was a little over 2 weeks away. Initial arrival date was about a week away, and then it got delayed to 2 weeks which was still okay just annoying. The TV arrived missing a part however so it could not be set up, and amazon would give no help saying that they don't open the boxes before they send them out.Told me I had to find the part myself and they would give me no discount and now the TV definitely won't be ready in time."
"It is now approaching three months I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THESE PRODUCTS:Your order 11741991 has been shipped on 05/29/2009 via USPS. Orders usually arrive in 4-10 business days, delivery may take longer in some cases, depending on US Postal Service's delivery schedule.Simply put I WANT A REFUND OF ALL OF THE MONEY YOU RECEIVED FROM NOW."
"KINDLE 2.0 DEFECT- i bought a Kindle cover for my 2.0 and it CRACKED my Kindle.  Amazon is taking no responsibility and saying this is a ""user misuse issue NOT a defect"".  The metal clips on the cover have cracked my Kindle 2.0 in two places. Nowhere on the Amazon site does it list that the cover can crack your Kindle for ""improper use"". i guess improper use is me keeping on my bedside and reading every nite. Whatever Amazon!"
"***INTERNET THIEVES***I placed an order for a watch for my girlfriend through amazon. She didn't like it and so I ended up returning it. Since it was sold by Macy's (through Amazon), I was instructed to return it to Macy's which I did although I gave my money to Amazon.Once Macy's confirmed the return, I contacted Amazon for a refund and was told that I need to talk to Macy's. I did that and they promptly sent me back to Amazon (which makes sense as Macy's did not have my credit card info).In this back and forth game, more than 90 days passed and then Amazon refused to help. So they took my money and I got nothing for it. All emails to Amazon after the 90 days went un-replied.Bunch of thieves. NEVER EVER SHOP THROUGH AMAZON. Even if they give a good deal, DON'T RISK YOUR MONEY!!!"
"AA battery order consisted of (1)-4pack and (1) 8 pack. Shipping time was extremely long and when package was received you could hear batteries rattling around in the box. Upon opening the container, it was obvious  there were loose batteries inside. The 8-pack blister cover had been completely separated from the cardboard backing at some time prior to shipping and it appeared I had received used batteries. I filed a ""bad packaging"" feedback but haver never received a response. I will not be inclined to order from Amazon.com again."
"When ordering from Amazon.com remeber that you are only as safe as the merchant's integrity.  Although I've had positive experiences in the past, my last transaction taught me a lesson.  The merchant (""Red Hot Buys"") pulled a fast one on me: sent a different brand of battery than the one I ordered, then made false promises about correcting the situation.  Now more than 30 days have passed and I'm hoping Amazon.com will intercede.  Be careful who you order from: not all Amazon.com merchants are honest.  Red Hot Buys certainly isn't"
Amazon will not refund the difference after they lowered the price $100 on a new tv about ten days after ordered. Take your business elsewhere to show Amazon this is expected from all retailers.
" Buyer beware of Amazon.com Bate and switch. The worst shopping experience I have ever had in my life. I had delivery confirmation for items that where suppose to be on sale, in stock only they were not. So they put my account order on hold and fed me some excuse that my card would not clear payment.I offered to call bank. When really they were out of stock so they just cancelled the order. After waiting all weekend.I talked to a representive, who told me I could reorder the items but now there at a higher price.representitive says ""they will give me the original discount price"".So when he tries to do this with me on phone. he gets back on phone and tells me the order is on hold again. Now I'm waiting another 24hrs to 48hrs.Don't think I should even trust the products will be OK now. Amazon you suck. THE WORST ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!"
"I purchased five hard drives through Amazon.com and their guarantee is a lie. They did not have their merchant honor what was advertised. They just canceled my order. I really expected more from Amazon.com. I shop from them a lot, but this will make me think twice about ordering from their merchants again. I am sorely disappointed with Amazon.com as they did not even bother to make things right or compensate my time and effort."
"I will never buy again from Amazon. That is it.Early this month I bought a brand-new VTech Dect 6.0 phone with 4 handsets one of which was defective. Amazon would not have the defective merchandise picked up and send me a replacement, nor would it send me a pre-paid shipping label. The customer must return the defective merchandise at his/her own expense for a reimbursement or replacement. I made many purchases from Amazon before. The merchandise arrived as expected each time. Therefore, I never had to return anything. This last time was an exception, but a bad one.Other online merchants I dealt with apologized and shipped me a replacement and had the defective merchandise picked up at their own expense if the merchandise they shipped were defective. Amazon would not do it. Their A-to-Z Guarantee Service is another joke. I contacted the manufacturer (VTech). They said I could return the phone to them for a replacement but I had to pay for the shipment because I did not buy the phone from their online factory store. It cost me $18.80 (UPS ground) to return the phone, and I am waiting for a replacement.Amazon.com is a great place to shop as long as you are lucky not to receive a defective merchandise. If your luck runs out like mine did with the last purchase, Amazon is not there when you need it.In closing, I will never buy again from Amazon. "
"The only thing that Amazon did right with my order was to have their automated system immediately return my call.  I am so thoroughly disgusted with Amazon.com and I had to demand that my order be canceled.  Amazon failed from the very beginning to do anything properly with my order.  They FAILED to get my billing information correct.   They FAILED to adhere to their two day estimate to ship from the beginning; I ordered on a Sunday and immediately the shipping estimate was THREE days later on a Wednesday.  Why in the world would I ever want to pay for an extra service of two day shipping when that service is not fulfilled as promised on the very first order.  Amazon FAILED by locking me out of my account because they FAILED to get my billing address correct.  They FAILED to read my email reply stating how unhappy I was with their lack of proper customer service and offer of redemption; they didn't bother to call me though I left my number and didn't ship by the alternate date.  They FAILED by telling me they could not ship my order to arrive until 4/13, this is nine days after my order and seven days after the promised two day shipping.  They FAILED when I was told on the phone that I could not cancel my order because it had already been shipped.  They FAILED by not unlocking my account and allowing me access so that I could review and/or change, or cancel my order.  I counted eight failures on Amazon's part in one simple order.  Scary that I gave such an irresponsible business my information so I demanded they close my account and remove all of my information from their database.  It just amazes me that I live less than 30  miles from Amazon headquarters and cannot make a simple purchase in a timely manner.  Count me as one very disgruntled customer lost to Amazon.  It would just be simpler if Amazon would just state from the beginning that they don't want or cannot handle new business.  It's way too easy to shop elsewhere."
"Today, I just placed an order for Sennheiser PC 350 Gaming Headset, $143.15 Sold by: Amazon.com, LLC. The item showed in stock. After placing the order, the order summary says the item won't ship until 4/13/09, and estimated delivery date of 4/20 - 4/24.It said my item was in ""Shipment #1: Shipping Soon  "" status. So I called up to inquire why it is going to take about a whole week for them to even ship it out from their warehouse. The first person I spoke to just repeated everything that was already available on the order summary. Over and over repeating the same thing. So I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor basically did the same thing, repeating what I already knew over and over again.Why can't you cancel my order if your not gonna ship it out until 6 days from now?"
"I purchased a Panasonic G1 camera, and extra zoom 45-200mm, and extra battery, as a package deal from Amazon.com. I found out later that the camera was sold by a company by the name of prophotobags. Unfortunately for me this company whose real name is Carmen's foto Source is a Canadian company. Therefore my camera does not have a valid USA warranty. I contacted Panasonic about this and they told me that they could not cover me at Panasonic USA for my warranty. I contacted the CEO of Amazon.com Mr. Jeff Bezos, I sent the material to him registered US mail and it was received a week ago yesterday, March 2, 2009. I have not heard anything back from them.I would highly recommend that any time you're buying something from Amazon.com you know exactly who the sellers are and that they are legitimate American companies. This Carmen's outfit also does business on eBay by another name.If you want to make sure that you're getting your full value for money and have a legitimate warranty on any products bought through Amazon you had better know who you're actually buying from.As for me, after doing business with Amazon.com for over 10 years and having good experiences,  I'm going to do my best to never buy anything from them again. I do not feel that they can be trusted after this experience."
"The shopping experience at amazon.com was terible. I am an international customer using an international VISA card, with shipping address in the US that is registered with my VISA office. I have filled that address as my billing and shipping address so they will send the bill there too.Soon after placing the order with my credit card, I tried to log in again and failed. My log in information was invalidated by Amazon.com , and when I called them it turned out that my account is on hold. It would have been nice if they would have given me a message about it when trying to log in , instead of making me think that my log in details are incorrect, like I forgot the password or something like that.I then ... after a long time, got an email that my account is on hold, and they require me to send them the billing statement of my financial institution. (see *)I have sent them a reply , giving them the phone number of the authorization department of my non-US based VISA office. I have also included a reference to that phone number on a secure site (https) of my VISA, so they could check that this number is authentic.I have got only automated responses from the Account Specialist email, and they were all preformatted, and ignored what ever I replied. They did not contact my financial institution, yes , I called my VISA office and they told me so. I then sent them the fax, that they wanted one day after, including my billing statement, which is in non Latin letters , so I don't know how they are going to read it, and I also attached a hand written page and mentioned there also my foreign billing address which is what is written on the statement. I wrote to them that my financial institution (VISA) would verify both addresses, and wrote my VISA's authorization phone number there again. I then got reply (No room for attachment due to 5000 letters limit) which is basically saying that what I faxed them doesn't have the information they need.I then replied by email, phoned, talked to the customer service department manager etc. It turns out that the ""Account Specialist"" does not have any direct phone line, and even the customer service department manager can not do anything but send the ""Account Specialist"" an email, so he did that, and it turned out that the ""Account Specialist"" did not bother to do anything even after that. My VISA office has still not been contacted and it is now 6 days after the placement of the order, after numerous emails and phone calls, and a fax.I am currently am limited on time, due to a time limited good shipping option of the items to my home country, and I had 8 days to get the items to my US address for that. This should have not been a problem with a two day shipping, or a one day shipping, but now it looks like it is not going to happen.In the meanwhile I have also received an email from the customer service department about an item that I have ordered that went out of stock in the meanwhile, which means that while they let me wait, they did not have the decency to reserve my order items which were in stock. I then saw that some of the other items are showing a ~""this is the last item on stock, to get it order soon""~.Out of options, I decided that maybe writing my US shipping address as billing address is the source of this problem, and since the Account Specialist seems to be an automaton, this is a dead end there, and maybe if I order again a and write my US shipping address as shipping address and my foreign billing address as billing address, it may get to the right department there, which handles foreign credit cards, and they will know how to resolve it. So I did that , and guess what - my account got locked a few minutes after placing the order, and a call to the customer service department revealed again that it is on hold, and if I would like , they could contact the Account Specialist on my behalf ...A day later I got the same e-mail that I have got before (see *), which means that the correct foreign billing address had no effect. By the way, before starting all of this I have contacted customer service and asked them if they respect international credit cards, and they said that they do, and that there should not be any problem.

"Amazon.com has become a sleazy bait & switch merchant; taking orders at low price but refusing delivery unless you reorder @ the higher price. Same product is listed with different ASIN (Amazon's internal number).Ordered Western Digital WDH2Q200000N External Drive, order number: 102-9940374-8256238 on February 9, 2009 for $229.99 delivered. My order is backordered, with no estimate of delivery, yet Amazon.com advertises the same item for $253.95 for immediate delivery http://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-WDH2Q20000N-Studio-Interface/dp/B0016P7H3Q/ref=wl_it_dp?ie=UTF8&coliid;=ICUNKOIRVY5AI&colid;=3PV20ZKTY6I2V"
"Stay away from Amazon's sub-sellers!! They are not amazon.com, they are not required to provide tracking numbers, they will bill you at time of order not time of shipment. With the combination of circumstances listed above you might be billed for something you'll never see. If you do receive your shipment it probably won't be on time. Greater than three weeks estimated time to deliver a textbook (supposedly in stock at time of order)is simply horrible, not receiving it after more than 3 weeks has led me to write this review. (note: the specific sub-seller is amitcj)"
"Bought this item and a day later they lowered the price right away. I asked for a refund and they refused. Then they have the nerve to claim to be:""Earth's Most Customer Centric Company""!!!???"
"Ordered 46-inch television on Dec. 16, which was shipped out that same day via Pilot Freight (an Amazon sub-contracted shipping company).  Online tracking, both on Amazon.com and Pilotair.com showed no updates whatsoever for a week’s time, then, on Dec. 23, tracking showed “THIS SHIPMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED” at 9:30am, and signed for by me.  While in reality the TV had never arrived, and I had signed for nothing.  I called Pilot Freight that evening to inquire, and the guy said, “Oh yeah…”, in a tone indicating he knew what had happened, and said to me my TV was in fact in Portland, OR (2 hours North of my location), and was safe and sound.  He said the TV would be delivered on Friday, the day after Christmas.  Friday passed with no call or delivery.  Online tracking continued to show my item had been delivered and signed for by me.  I called Amazon.com to inquire, and the outsourced difficult to understand English representative told me the false information presented on the Amazon tracking site was “Due to computer delays”, and that I’d be getting my TV “as soon as possible”.  Getting nowhere with that call, I sent an email to Amazon.com insisting that they show me my signature from the delivery that they claimed had already been made.  A day and a half later I received a call from Amazon indicating that the false information on their tracking site was the fault of the shipping contractor (Pilot), and that it was an “honest mistake”.  The representative said he couldn’t/wouldn’t provide me with a copy of the delivery signature, and that the TV would be delivered on Monday, 12/29.  End of call.    Shortly thereafter, the field “Signed for by:”, which had previously shown MY name, was changed to someone else’s, but the site continued to show that the TV had already been delivered on 12/23 at 9:30am.  Monday passes, and no call from the shipping company to arrange for delivery, and no TV had arrived.  Various items on both the Amazon and Pilot tracking site were changed, however.  I call Pilot freight again, and they say they can’t/won’t produce the signature showing that I had originally signed for delivery on 12/23, and that the error was the result of a new employee improperly entering information into their system(s).  Meanwhile, some time on 12/29, the online tracking on Amazon.com and Pilotair.com showed that my TV had been delivered on December 31, 1969 at 3:59:59pm.  (I’m not joking.)  I allow Tuesday to pass, and no call to arrange for delivery was made, and, obviously, no TV delivery.  Then, that evening, I get a message from the freight company indicating that they had my TV, but it didn’t match the TV I had ordered.  They apparently had a Samsung LN46A630, NOT the LN46A650 which I had clearly ordered, originally.  They requested a call back, asking what I wanted to do about it.  Upon my return call, I told them to take the TV back; I had had enough of this exercise of total ineptitude.  I called Amazon to cancel the order that evening, and was told by the outsourced representative that he couldn’t fully process the cancellation, as that would require a manager who was not on duty at the time.  I was told to call back the next day to arrange for cancellation.  Upon my call on 12/31, they didn’t have record of my cancellation, so I had to once again furnish the Amazon rep with the information needed to cancel the order.  I was told to call yet ANOTHER number, this time a U.S. center, to finalize cancellation of order.  So I called it, demanded cancellation and full refund, and was granted my request.  Although the rep said it would take unit they get the TV back for me to receive my refund, which is a dubious requirement given the incompetence of their shipping contractor in the first place. Overall I’m shocked and extremely angry over this transaction.  I ordered my television on a specific date so that I would receive it in time for a bowl game that I, friends, and family had been looking forward to for some time.  So Amazon and Pilot effectively shafted our plans, and blunted enjoyment of the gathering and event.  A rude dose of Amazon.com holiday cheer, if you will.  Another reality is, while indeed small in amount, Amazon has been making money on MY money, while never delivering the TV I paid for in full.  As such, I intend to ask them for the interest I otherwise would have been making, as it’s MY money.  I want it. To conclude, I shall never trust Amazon again, and am absolutely beside myself in realizing the incompetence they’ve demonstrated over this entire transaction.  Even at this point in time, the Amazon tracking site shows that my television WAS delivered--  This time it shows that my TV was delivered on 12/31 at a time that hasn’t even arrived yet at the time of this writing.  Truly incredible…"
"I have ordered from Amazon for 2 years and this holiday season was absolutely terrible!  It seemed that every package I ordered was damaged due to NO packing material in the box.  The breaking point (literally), was when I ordered a 26"" flat screen TV.  They put it inside a large box with no packing material and at least 4"" space around the tv.  Needless to say, it arrived with the outer box crushed in on two sides, not to mention the tv box damaged also.  When we finally found a number to call, no one could speak English, and were very hard to communicate with.  This was a Christmas gift, so we asked if they were going to send out a replacemnt by Christmas, and were told we would have to wait 3 to 5 weeks.  When we told them that wouldn't work, they suggested that we return it and wait for a refund and buy it from a local store.  Absolutely no customer service, NOR willing to fix their mistake.  They tried to blame it on UPS, but it was them who didn't put any packing material in the box.  That's not UPS's fault.  I will never order any expensive items from this company again.  They obviously don't care what the item does, once it leaves the warehouse."
"Ordered a 50"" Plasma TV, arrived cracked, refused to replace it. I lost 1299.00"
"A NIGHTMAREFalse advertisement, rude customer service, does not honor advertisement, Amazon.com is now just another cheesball online retailer.End result of many many hours dealing with this issue = I will refused delivery and dispute the return shipment charges.A loyal customer for 10 yrs will never buy anything from Amazon again.The time spent on the phone and researching policies for shipping/returns/etc. is in the hours -I spent hours comparing online TV shopping - discovered blogs/stories of nightmares - broken TVs delivered with no manufacturer's warranty - gave up decided to wait till prices dropped and I would by at Magnolia.Then found the Amazon price and white glove delivery - and spent hours reviewingAmazon site and reviews6Ave siteOncecall.com (Amazon vendor used on Nov 26)The ad for free white glove service ran for multiple days (Nov 26, 27, and 28) on the same Amazon.com webpage where you buy the TV. The ad stated ""When you purchase this TV from Amazon.com, it receives our special white-glove delivery service - an then goes on to explain what the white glove service is. I would only buy a TV if it came from an authorized dealer (both 6Ave and Onecall are) and was delivered with white glove = delievry people unbox and test the TV before they leave. If it's broken, defective, or missing parts they take it back right then an there.Nov 28 - placed the order - called Amazon Sales - they confirmed I would receive the white glove delivery and that my order would have the special holiday protection return policy (20 mins on the phone)The ad for free white glove service ran for multiple days (Nov 26, 27, and 28)Dec 1 - received email confirming TV was shipped - estimated delivery date of Dec 4 - Dec 9 - no mention of white glove delivery in the shipment notice.Received email confirming the TV bracket shippped - estimated delivery date of Dec 4 - Dec 9 - I would not have bought the bracket without buying the TV.Dec 2I called 6Ave customer service - confirmed - I am not getting the white glove delivery (15 mins)(45 mins) Amazon Customer Service - told me they don't offer free white glove delivery from 3rd party vendors and that white glove would cost an additional $125. Amazon told me to refuse the shipment and place another orderThis was unaccpetable and I requested to speak with a supervisor - I explained Amazon advertized Free White glove delivery and I had proof with a print out of the webpage at the time of purchase. I requested I be forwarded to the Amazon customer service department specializing Plasma TVs - instead the Amazon customer service rep forwarded me to 6Ave without telling me.Jessica Vellasco of 6Ave customer service instructed me to fax the page to 6Ave customer service at: 973-467-2286, order number L83824 and that someone would call me after they receive the fax. I did, and she said they don't offer the white glove service for orders coming from Amazon. Fair enough, but I'm not talking with the right person. The mistake was not 6ave's it was Amazon's for advertising the white glove servie. It is Amazon that made the mistake and should honor the white glove service. Amazon should contact 6Ave and arrange for my TV to be delivered with white glove service - something Amazon offers for a $125 charge nationwide.More Amazon customer service calls - another 45 mins - escallated finally (it took many repeated and heated requests to be forwarded to a manager - Amit K - refused to give last name - Amit reafirmed that I would not receive the white glove delivery, but maybe you qualify for the Amazon A-Z guarantee… but check, as not all vendors qualify."
"Was tricked by Amazon during a black friday deal:I, and apparently others, were tricked on this sale! The order was cancelled for no apparent reason! Apparently integrity means nothing anymore. I second the comments from another user regarding ""Bait and Switch"" as they were taken by this offer as well. I have definately lowered my trust in amazon.com, and will look to other ""reliable"" sources that have integrity and back their claims! It's not the end of the world, but I am definately upset that I was tricked by amazon.com's sales tactics! -William Redfern "
"Place an order for Olympus E520 camera on 11/19 with the super savers shipping (5-9 days) and when I placed the order it showed eta of 11/26 (7 days). Then when I confiming email from Amazon the eta date was 12/4 - 12/10. Way more than 5-9 days. I cancelled the order, will reorder elsewhere."
I ordered an Epson V500 Photo Scanner from  Amazon.com. Amazon advertized this scanner qualified for a $50.00 rebate from Epson and even furnished the rebate form.Well it turns out Amazon is not an authorized dealer and my rebate was rejected.Here is the notice of rejection I received fromEpson:Email: Offer: EPSON DENIALS Submission Type: Original Submission Current Status: Declined Date Processed: Nov 08 2008 Check Print Date: Not available Check Ship Date: Nov 10 2008 Unqualified Due To: Store were purchased not eligible.I will never use Amazon again they are not to be trusted.
VERY FAKE CUSTOMER SUPPORT. THEY DO NOT CONTACT THEIR RESELLERS IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES WITH THE ORDER..THEY JUST HAVE A BIG GOOF UP IN THE ADMINISTRATION. I HAVE GOT MY LESSONS SO STAY AWAY.
"Three IN STOCK items ordered directly from Amazon on 11/1/2008, and super saver shipping was selected.  Finish order and I see that I was expected to receive the order between 12/3-12-15!!!  WTF?  I figured I would wait a few days and as before with many orders, it would ship...  NOPE, 5 days later and the order had still not been processed, let alone shipped.  Order canceled, and bought items elsewhere.I have shopped with Amazon for years, and although I have had good experiences with them for the most part, this last order is enough!  I am plenty patient, but a month and two weeks projected arrival time for IN STOCK items...  PLEASE!  Nice job Amazon.  "
"Poor Customer Service ordered item when website stated available on August 26th. Today November 10th it shows still on backorder while Amazon made me update my payment informations a few times because of the item being backordered. Gave me about 5 different dates so far and guess what it hasn't shipped on either one.Customer Serivce is joke, I wished actually they could speak english on the phone or try to answer an email with selfwritten text instead of the automated crap.Further they changed price guarantee policy since September 1st, whats up with that they don't refund you the difference anymore but they pay for return shipping so you can return it and order it for the new price LOL what a joke. Its seriously time to look for an alternative to Amazon.com. I thought buying Prime Membership was great Free 2 Day shipping but what good does it do if the processing time is so slow that i could have ordered the same item elsewhere with ground shipping and had it faster. All over its time i make a review about amazon.com since screwed up quiet alot lately."
"     Beware clicking on any offers for Amazon.com credit as they are providing your information to other credit card companies.  I have been a long time Amazon.com customer.  Even if I'm looking at an item on another site I look to see if Amazon.com has it for less before I buy.       Recently I clicked on a link on one of their product pages offering $25 off your next purchase by applying for an Amazon.com credit card.  I looked it over and decided to apply.  I was still on Amazon.com's website when I filled out the application.  It was supposed to take 30 seconds for approval, but after that time it told me they would contact me.  I just assumed I had been turned down, though I didn't know why as my credit score is over 700.     Several weeks after applying I received a call.  The caller stated they were with Amazon.com and asked if I still wanted the credit card I had applied for.  I told them yes and they processed it for me at that time.  When I received the card it was an Amazon.com Store Card and indicated that it was actually a different company, GEMoney.com.  I didn't think much about it as I believed they were just processing the credit purchases for Amazon.com.  It even indicated that Amazon.com would automatically switch my default payment method to this new card, which they did.     When I received my first bill I noticed that I didn't receive a $25 credit on my first purchase.  I made several calls and eventually was told by a GEMoney.com representative that this was a different card, I had an Amazon.com Store Card and the $25 off first purchase was only for an Amazon.com Visa card, so I was told I wasn't eligible for the $25 off promotion.  That didn't sound right so I called Amazon.com and spoke to a customer service representative who would only identify himself as Ace.     I was on the phone for nearly an hour, much of it on hold, before he finally told me the same thing, I had a different card than the one I had applied for.  I was shocked that they would provide my customer information to other companies to solicit credit card applications, but it got worse.  He told me they have three different Amazon credit cards and if I understood him correctly they provided my information to at least those three other companies.  I received a rash of pre-approved credit offers at about the same time I was called about the Amazon.com card so I really don't know to what extent the private information I provided them with was shared with other companies but it does worry me.     I think it is just horrible that they would provide my personal information to other companies after I clicked a link to apply for thier card and filled out the application on their site.  To allow another company to call me and represent itself as Amazon.com when it isn't is simply fraud.  It is a simple bait and switch, they offer a $25 off your first purchase promotion to obtain the needed information for a credit card application and then provide that information to other companies.  At no point was I told I wouldn't receive $25 off my first purchase.       I've been a customer of Amazon.com for a long time, but I'm really going to have to give some thought before making any more purchases.  I have already deleted the Amazon.com Store Card as my default method of payment and I won't be using it again.   "
"I ordered a product from amazon.com and it arrived in horrible quality and looked to be used. I called up amazon and tried to speak to someone, and waited about 45 minutes to get through to a real person! Their customer service sucks, and they could not even resolve my issue. They told me that it was from a third party that just posted products on their website, and that I could not go through amazon to get my money back but had to go directly through this third party! Thats great, represent products that you guys cannot even gaurantee will happen, even though you have your A to Z gaurantees posted on your website, I hope everyone checks their fine print."
"I am very disapointed in Amazon customer service.  It is near impossible to actually speak to someone.I was shipped an order 3 months late.  Because the order came so late I had already purchased the books.  When I was told I could use the return lables and be refunded the shipping cost, I did so but was never refunded the shipping costs.  I attempted to contact customer service by phone but their phone lines do not pick up or redirect you to some automated service without an option to actually speak to someone.  I tried numerous times and was never able to settle the issue.  I have been so frustrated with their lack of contactability that I gave up.It is now a year later and I just signed up for this rating.com thing and thought I would finally vent about this to someone since Amazon.com doesn't provide their oun reviews. "
"Amazon had a sweet deal on an Evga GTX260 video card thru TigerDirect. Did not think that it was somewhat suspicious since I do not know how much these cards normally run. It turns out that between Amazon and TigerDirect there was a database error and the price that was advertised at Amazon corresponds to a different item at Tigerdirect. I had my order eventually cancelled by Amazon because they said that ""Order cancelled by merchant"". I think, (IMHO) Amazon should've handled this a lot better and to think that there was not a mention of an apology from them and acting like they didn't know about the whole thing. I am a Prime member so I guess that will not last long and this should be my last time shopping with them."
"On Sept. 18th I ordered a Slingbox Pro through Amazon.  I received a confirmation saying to expect my order between Sept 24 & 29th.  On Sept. 26 I receive an impersonal, no-reply email saying your order has been canceled.  Who do you talk to at Amazon, it is like being lost int he Amazon forest - is that where the name came from.  Crazy thing is they still have the same product, same price listed and taking orders. I'll take my business elsewhere before I wait a week to be told they canceled my order no explanation!"
"I ordered an item Sold and Shipped from Amazon.com and before the item shipped the price on the item was lowered.  I contacted Amazon.com and they told me that the only recourse was to refuse shipment of the order and I would be refunded the full amount.  I told them that they were not only inconveniencing the customer but also losing money by biting the shipping cost. This was their price that they would be matching. Customer Service would've dictated that they just go into their computer and adjust the price they were charging me. Instead, they will lose their shipping cost and more than likely a regular return customer, plus I will be telling anyone I can this story. My new store of choice is Buy.com."
"When I ordered I asked for 2 day USPS expediated shipping>>>Order showed no action for at least a week & when I called by phone, I was told that they never had this item!>>>I patiently kept the order open (Could've & should've cancelled it!)>>>After being told via Email my order would ship between 10/1/2008 & 10/15/2008 Amazon has added ""insult to injury"" by Emailing me today stating that they WILL NOT get the item in!!! I'm a very dissatisfied customer!!!"
"Item came as promised, but couldn't get a copy of my invoice. "
"""BOYCOTT AMAZON.COM...!!!!!!!""Like one of the other reviewers, my Amazon.com account was suddenly closed without warning by the account services people at Amazon because I had returned too many items that were damaged due to poor packaging.  For people shopping at Amazon.com, I just want to warn you that unless you have low expectations for the quality of the products you purchase, this is not the place where you want to shop.  Yes, Amazon.com does offer cheaper prices for certain products (NOT ALL PRODUCTS) on their sites, but as the old addage goes, you get what you pay for.  And don't expect them to change their habits of using CHEAP packaging for the items you puchased because I was never able to convince them to use better packaging after all the incidents that I had with damaged items purchase thru them or their affiliated sellers.  They will only penalize you, the consumer for returning damaged items too many times.  Most people (just like myself) think that Amazon.com have a good returns policy with the so call ""A-Z buyer protection plan"", but the real truth is that they treat the consumer as a means to squeeze money from rather than to provide good service to.  It all sounds good, but try returning damaged or defective products a few times in a row and your account could be SHUT DOWN without even a WARNING!!!!Frankly, I was always hesitant to shop with them and this experience only confirms and reinforces my apprehensions about shopping on their site.  ""BUYER BEWARE...!!!!""To all buyers out there, just be sure you don't return the items you buy from Amazon.com regardless of damage or defects or risk loosing your account."
"8/22/08- I pre-ordered software from Amazon.com using a gift card. When placing the order there were 2 ""Pre-Order"" icons. Sadly, I disnt realize one was with Amazon and one was with a ""Third Party Seller"".After realizing the order was being processed under Amazon AND Hubbagames (3rd party) I got concerned. I saw that Hubbagames did NOT have a phone number on thier site. I sent 2 emails to cancel the order. One to Amazon and one to Hubbagames. No response from Hubbagames.I ordered the same software directly from Amazon.com, since I do NOT do online business without a phone number to call (Hubbagames). I spoke to Amazon's customer service. Your typical foregin call center. Explained that I needed the first order cancelled and the gift card applied to the second order. Trying to get them to understand was hard enough. I was told they cant cancel the order placed with the 3rd party seller. I have to cancel with them. I explained I tried and it hasnt happend. I asked for a contact number for Hubbagames and was told they dont have a phone number. I asked how they do business with a company that does not have a phone #, and was told they are not required to have a phone #. Odd. I thought standards would be higher.I spoke to a supervisor (Cody B.) and was told he will personally take the 3rd party order placed with a $50 gift card, and apply it to my second order, so I would only be paying $4 and some change, one the oder gets cancelled. I said great, and asked for an e-mail detailing that information. I never recieved that e-mail.8-29-08- First order through the 3rd party seller has STILL not been canceled. No response from Hubbagames. Called Customer service again. Was told it might take 1-2 weeks to get it the 3rd party order cancelled going through Amazon. Was also told by a new supervisor (Jason), that they will apply the gift card from the 3rd party order to the second order placed directly with Amazon. Again, asked for the e-mail to confirm it. Still nothing.I will NOT be doing business with Amazon.com again. Their 3rd party sellers are no-name businesses with no contact info. Be VERY careful when ordering with Amazon.com. Make sure you are NOT buying from a 3rd party. And good luck calling customer service. Good luck with understanding them, and them understanding you. Its a call center with no idea of what they are doing. They dont even give out last names so they dont have to take responsability for what they tell you.There are plenty of other e-tailers out there that DO communicate with the customer. I would suggest trying them first."

"I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH AMAZON AGAIN, I ONLY USE THEIR SITE FOR INFORMATION, and I buy thousands to tens of thousands of dollars of merchandise online each year. Keep reading to find out why... AMAZON is the WORST MAJOR ONLINE RETAILER that I have done business with.  A high percentage of their items are now sold through secondary retailers called the AMAZON MARKETPLACE and while many of these vendors are good, MANY OF THEM ARE NOT!  AMAZON refuses to act responsibly when it comes to these vendors.  EXAMPLE: I purchased a high end memory card through AMAZON from a vendor called electronics-fast.  Thinking that if I purchased through AMAZON I would receive authentic merchandise backed by AMAZON. After I ordered the card I heard that some of the cards being sold were COUNTERFEIT, so when I received the card I called SanDisk the manufacturer of the card to check its authenticity.  I learned that the card I purchased through AMAZON was counterfeit.  When I contacted AMAZON they took a long time to respond, but agreed to seek a refund.  They asked me to send the item back to electronics-fast for a refund, and electronics-fast sent me an e-mail telling me to send it to a PO Box where they would receive it and then send me a refund.  The problem I have with this is that the item sold to me MADE IT AN ILLEGAL TRANSACTION (fraud and distributing counterfeit merchandise), so I demanded that AMAZON give me the name and business address of the company so I could contact law enforcement. Amazon refused and I have not returned the card and have not received a refund,  My credit card company is persuing it and VISA TELLS ME THAT THEY RECEIVE A HUGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT AMAZON.  Stay AWAY."
"This was a third party order for laptop memory that was ""in stock"".  During the on-line ordering process Amazon shifted suppliers for a few cents savings.  Unfortunately the ""in-stock"" hardware was never delivered.  I wish I could recall the specific supplier to pass along that information."
"I have purchased many things through Amazon.  That has now stopped.  I made an order in January for three items.  Two shipped promptly.  The other started a three month saga.  The ship date was extended time after time all the while it continued to be shown as ""In Stock"" on the web site.  I tried to resolve this on many occasions.  Several time I was told that the ""In Stock"" report on the web was an error and it would take up to a week to resolve.  It was never resolved.  On two occasions, I was promised that it would be resolved and shipped.I was told that they would credit my account $10, toward future purchase, for my trouble and I waited again.I contacted the manufacturer of the item and they assured me that their were plenty even as Amazon kept telling me that it was back ordered from the supplier.Finally after inquiring to another extension, I received an e-mail from a member of a ""special team"" that resolves problems.  I was told that a 'glitch' in the computer was holding up my order and that I needed to cancel and reorder.  I voiced a concern that canceling the order would deny the higher-ups the data on problems.  I then received a reply from a different ""special team"" member offering a $50 refund and that he had canceled my order and entered the item in my shopping cart.  I would have to notify them of the order number.1. Why could they not fix the problem without my intervention?  I asked.  It was not answered.2.  Why should I trust that they will get me the $50 promised when they cannot do their basic business promptly.  Would not a $50 credit  in my account be more appropriate or just discount my original order?3.  Why no continuity of contact from the ""special team.""  They left me no way to contact the same person.  I only got a link to the form to input and get a response from a different person.Buy if you wish from this company but, they have lost my business.  I worked hard to find a similar price on a GPS I just bought.  Amazon is easy as long as there are no problems."
"I ordered a soft case for a camera and three books. All items were available in stock. On the fourth day after order date Amazon did not ship them yet, and their system indicated that it would take two more days before the package leaves their warehouse. I called their customer services and inquired about the reason for such a long delay. I was told that the only reason was their policy to delay orders for which free shipping was selected. I congratulated their business model and canceled the whole order. This is not the first time that I had such problems with Amazon.com."
"Purchased Pioneer speakers TS 1343R from Amazon on sept 16,2010 and on the web page it said that grills were included, they are not, pioneer does not include Grills with that model speaker, I email Amazon pointing this out, and they offered to allow me to return the speakers, which had already been installed and other grills used-thinking that would correct the web page,they did not nor have they as of 11-18-2010 and this is after having talked to customer service on the telephone. The last email they sent me again offered to allow me to return the Speakers but say anything about correcting the the web page, We should not have to double check everything Amazon sells."
As an experience in frustration this is one of the worst. After ordering a great deal on a 46 inch LCD Sony XBR5 the oder was flagged due to a wrong expiration date on the card submitted. The fraud department did not contact me nor did Amazon until I tried to track why my order was not arriving after a week as promised. The customer service person I called could not help and did  refer to a frad person who emailed a request for the statement to be faxed which I immediately did. They responded it did not have the required information and asked me to fax a statement that had the required info. Since I do not write these statements from Mastercard I called customer service to ask for help to resolve this and received an exact copy of the first e-mail requesting the statement I already faxed them. I cancelled the order.
There 3rd party vendors really suck. Any thing to make a buck. They should just stick to there own items. More respect. Took two weeks to recieve item.
"Buyers beware. I ordered Pentax K100D Super camera on January 21, 2008 from Amazon and waited til March 10 for item to be shipped, and it was never shipped to me. My money were never charged, so that's covered. I also ordered Pentax-compatible Sigma lense, SD card and AA-batteries. All these items are now beyond 30 days return restriction. Now I canceled camera piece of order, and cannot buy K100D Super anywhere except from companies whom I don't trust, it's discontinued and out of stock everywhere.I bought K10D (was forced - what would I do with that Sigma lense now?) from other good vendor and it's been shipped next day, not 1.5 month delayed!I would not order this camera from Amazon and next time I will be careful ordering anything which states ""shipped in 1-3 month"".What's more - I didn't get any letter of apology or gift card from Amazon. Business as usual - that's what it is."
Worst buying experience ever!!!They deleted my order twice without notifying me and up to this day thay have not replied to my complain.STAY AWAY FROM AMAZON YOU HAVE BETTER CHANCES WITH E-BAY!!!
"Ordered a Philips VOIP841 PC-Free DECT 6.0 Wireless IP Phone set and one additonal phone set. Sent me an e-mail confirmation saying the anticipated delivery date will be between 2/22/08 to 2/25/08. It's not wonderful considering if you buy anything from Newegg.com you get it the next day or two without any premium. Since then, no e-mail has come my way so I went to Amazon.com for an update. Now it says the shipping will be 2/25 and I won't get my stuff until after March 3. Will never ever buy anything from Amazon ever again."
I ordered two chocolates on Feb 10. One was sent out on Feb 14. Another was not sent out yet when I write this review on Feb 19. I don't know when it will ship to me. But I will not order anything from amazon.
"I Have been shopping at amazon.com for over 7 years and shutter to think of the amount of money I spent on that site.  But buyer beware when you have to return an item and get a refund.  I have been going through h--- trying to get my refund.  They state that it was put through to my bank but it was not.  This has become a real nightmare and the customer service has been horrific.  I have been hung up on and practically called a liar about not receiving the refund.  One month later, I still wait.  They finally admitted that there was a mistake on their end but still I don't have the money.   I don't care if I have been shopping there for this long, they have lost my business for all time.  Still waiting and extremely aggravated and discouraged shopper."
"I also have never had a problem ordering through Amazon...until now. I ordered a Aluratek 10.5-Inch Digital Photo Frame (POS) on October 21. It arrived promply but the frame is a major POS. I returned the item after much frustration waiting for an RMA. The item was delivered back to Ritz on 6 november. I bought this item from Amazon...via Ritz...and now I am told that Ritz can take 180 days to provide a refund. What incentive do they have to provide a refund sooner? Now I have to worry about who supplies the product when I buy from Amazon? No chance I will order again after this...It is now January 15th and I still don't have a refund...I filed a claim with my credit card, and they now think that I should get my refund by the end of March. Beware!"
"My wife and I lost complete trust in amazon.comWe ordered a $1500+ diamond ring.  Note, we bought the ring directly through amazon's ring configuration center.. this is not through their 3rd party merchants.  The diamond ring is color E and clarity VS2.  We returned it for a refund due to quality issues.  We bought it on 11/23/07 and before we return it, we made sure to ask them the return date, we actually called, and they say due to the holiday seasons, the return date is 30 days, and it's all over the web site that due to the holiday season, the returns will be extended.  We even have a print out that the last day to return THIS item is on 1/31/08.  The reason why we held onto this first ring is because we ordered a second identical ring of a higher grade and we wanted to compare it, especially when the return date has been extended.So we returned it, bought a better grade diamond, but surprise, we get a two canned emails saying we returned it after 30 days, and that the ring is scratched all over.  This is complete bullshit.  It's said that due to these two reasons, the ring could not be refunded so they returned the shipment to us.  Well, we refused shipment and will dispute this through our credit card company, Better Business Bureau, plus a few news stations.Unfortunately, we didn't find out about the refund issue on time and ordered a higher grade ring.  Upon inspection of the ring under a light, this second ring is scratched, as though it's with sandpaper, INSIDE where the metal meets the finger.  I have a feeling should we decide on refunding the second ring, we will have difficulty since the second ring is bought with a amazon credit card.  We are fortunate to have bought the first ring with a credit card that's non-amazon.  I learned NEVER to use amazon's credit card to buy expensive items.  Amazon's jewelry is of poor quality and workmanship.  We will have this second ring appraised and see if it matches the certificate.  If it doesn't, you can bet there's going to be a second refund, and another fight!I am right now going to cancel all backorders of other items I have with amazon.  I’m really surprised that amazon has a poor rating here at resellersratings.com  Wake up people, amazon only cares about their numbers.  If you can buy an identical item, buy it somewhere else. You won't believe it until you experience bad customer service.  "
"ordered serveral items from amazon marketplace, these items get cancelled with no explanation, called to inquire, customer service suggested to reorder..now price gone up--sometimes doubled. amazon plays these very deceptive marketing schemes.  be careful when ordering big ticket items like tv's--these are shipped from 3rd party companies like Beach Audio not from amazon. if there is a problem with the order once it arrives, you will have to deal directly with that store--most times they have no refund polices and restocking fees."
"Watch out for Amazon's partner merchants! I've had pretty good results when I ordered from Amazon itself (books, movies, etc) but I've had all kinds of problems with order fullfillment from merchants who use Amazon's portal. For this year's disaster: on December 13 I ordered a gift pack from Fireworks Popcorn through Amazon. Delivery was promised between December 19 and 24. I received an automated e-mail message from Amazon on Dec 25, stating that my order hadn't been shipped and I wouldn't be billed. I sent a reply back, asking for some information on my order and that apparently went to a human being. The next day I got a reply from customer service at Fireworks Popcorn, stating that they got buried in orders from Amazon and just couldn't deliver in time for Christmas. They ""promised"" to get my order out on Dec 26. On Friday December 28 I got an e-mail from Amazon telling me that my order finally went to UPS late that day and I do have a UPS number for the shipment. With the New Years holiday, and the fact that the package is going to the DelMarVa peninsula (which seems to add an extra day or two to delivery), delivery is promised for January 4. So my Christmas present won't even make it in time for New Years Day.The comments I read on Amazon's merchant feedback leave me with the impression that Fireworks Popcorn is a small specialty company that decided to go national by listing with Amazon. They don't have any idea how to fill large numbers of holiday gift orders in a timely manner. Hiring  some extra help might be a good start for next year.I can't speak to the product itself, but if delivery for a holiday is a concern to you, you might want to look at another vendor who understands how to do e-commerce.  1/3/08 - I checked Amazon this AM and it looks like Amazon has stopped selling Fireworks Popcorn procucts (everything is listed as ""currently unavailable"") Good job by Amazon in pulling the plug on those folks.  "
"All it takes is one screw-up to ruin my trust, and this one was BEYOND UNACCEPTABLE.I ordered a DVD to be shipped to a friend for Christmas, and the shipping option I chose explicitly told me, ""This item WILL arrive at the location on or before December 24th."" It was a guarantee that they made sure to slam on anything and everything around Christmas, to give a false sense of security that they would come through.They lied.The item shipped on December 18th, and on that day my expected delivery date changed from December 23rd to December 26th. This deceptive advertisement, posting a big cheery notice that ""the item WILL be delivered"" before Christmas was absolutely unforgivable.To make matters worse, according to my Amazon tracking, the item was delivered on December 27th, and it was signed for by a person named Mattis. I guess it would be fine that it was late, but today my friend told me HE NEVER GOT THE DVD. My friend has no one living there with a name that even comes CLOSE to ""Mattis"". He confirmed that I had entered his address correctly.Amazon, you had millions of items to ship out during Christmas, but this is just BS. You made deliberate false promises, presumably shipped it to the WRONG address, and now you have my money.I had more than 30 orders with you before, but trust me, I'm only using you as a LAST RESORT from now on. ALL future DVD purchases are coming from the online stores DVD Pacific or RightStuf. They are trustworthy and reliable. YOU ARE NOT.*update*I noticed that someone is voting down people that leave negative reviews for Amazon. This person should be banned from the site immediately.*2nd update*My girlfriend had to buy a birthday present for someone. It needed to be there in four days, so we opted for two day shipping. Even though the item was in stock and Amazon told us it would get there  the day before the birthday party, Amazon notified us on the would-be arrival date that the shipping date had been delayed a FULL WEEK.I still don't appreciate an Amazon fanboy voting us down for daring to call Amazon out on its poor management. I've placed many orders with Amazon over the past 10 years, and to be treated like garbage after all this time in consecutive orders is just MADDENING. My DVD purchases are now from DVDPacific.com. My game purchases are from independent sellers. Amazon has lost my business forever."
"Amazon WAS my favorite place for electronics and books. My recent 3 purchases of books had changed this. My problem was with the packaging. Most books in last three shipment arrived damaged, some pretty badly. No shrink wrap was used anymore. Virtually no padding.I am looking somewhere else for books."
"Amazon sent me a confirmation email that my order went through.Three days later they sent me an email titled "" Your Amazon.com order (#xxx-yyy-xxx): your approval required"" in which they were asking if a later shipping date was OK. I confirmed.Three Days later yet another email stating that they have to push the date back even further. Still OK with me.THEN however, right after I confirmed, they cancel the order stating ""..displayed at an incorrect price"".So WHY oh WHY do they make me go through the HASSLE to read and CONFIRM SEVERAL TIMES a later delivery date, if it was a typical amazon-error to begin with??Their ""service"" is a joke. Amazon was good at some point, but is declining rapidly. Time to get rid of the stocks."
"Officially advertised Black Friday sale items have been just cancelled after two weeks wait by such a lame excuse ""Price Mistake""? Can't believe I stayed up to 3 AM and just got this official rip-off eventually. You call yourself a reputable online retailer, really?"
This place is the worst place on the internet. They are total crooks can you say take the money and run. That is what happened. I ordered paid and they shipped it to who knows where and will not reship or refundScammers
"I pre-ordered this item 2 weeks before it was to be released. The day after it was to be released, LESS THAN 2 WEEKS BEFORE CHRISTMAS, they canceled my order. Unbelievable I'll be damned if they ever receive one cent of my money again."
"BUYERS BEWAREI preordered an item from AMAZON and was given a confiramtion on good faith that I would be receiving the item before Christmas for my children.  One day AFTER the item should have been shipped to me, I received an email from AMAzON stating simply that they were sorry they took too many orders for the items and it was being deleated from my order history.  But not to worry that my credit card had not been charged.  UNEXCEPTABLE... Santa is not bringing my children's gift because it is too late to get it elsewhere and AMAZON did not follow through with their order.  THey should not be taking so many preorders if they do not intend to honor them!  NO COMPENSATION whatsoever is offered just a ""I am sorry"".  They are the grinch who stole christmas from my kids.  After being on the phone for over 1/2 hour getting disconnected once...I got no compensation from AMAZON except the ""I am sorry"".  They then have the nerve to send me an email asking if my problems were solved with customer service.  I answered the email by going to the provided link to tell them again what I thought of them not honoring their orders or compensating people.  The link asks you to type in your phone number so they can call you back..I did this and when they called back I was diconnected!!!!   UNEXCEPTABLE!!! UNPROFESSIONAL!!UNRELIABLE!!!   I put the emphasis on UNRELIABLE...   BUYERS BEWARE WHEN ORDERING FROM AMAZON  BUY ELSEWHERE from a company that values their customers and honors their orders  don't be sucked in by some blind promise they don't intend to keep."
"Never bought at Amazon until a few months ago. I received my products and was happy. I even got a Amazon charge card so I could buy more. My wife is an avid shopper and when I told her about amazon she started making a list of stuff she wants. BUT Now I hate amazon. Because I feel AMAZON PURCHASES CANNOT BE TRUSTED. Their Black Friday sale was not honored. I could have bought elsewhere without loosing out on Black Friday promotions.What I don't understand is: How can Amazon claim a pricing error ??? when their policy states:QUOTE: ""With respect to items sold by Amazon, we cannot confirm the price UNTIL YOU ORDER, however we don't charge your credit card..""THEY ACCEPTED MY ORDER, and even send a confirming email of shipping date. Then 10 days later cancels the shipping, claiming pricing error when there was none when the order was taken. And why did it take so long ?? How can they get away with that ?They lost me as buyer and references from me, including an addicted buyer (my wife).To me shopping at Amazon turned out to be penny wise during the year, but pound foolish on a day when everyone discounted their products more than 50% (percent).Also had a Terrible Experience with Customer Service, and everyone, sooner or later, will run into the need when customer service is required to be top notch. Is this deceptive advertising and the Rebate is worthless ? Has anyone looked into a class action ? (If a lawyer takes a class action case, there is no charge to the consumer or claimants.)"
"I too had problems with multiple orders on Black Friday. First they cancelled the MX revolution mouse I ordered. Next they cancelled the PS3 Sixaxis Controller and then they cancelled both the MX5000 keyboard mouse combo and the Logitech Webcam.  Not only did they cancel them they completely deleted them off my order history. I called the CSRs who said they were out of stock but I pointed out that they were indeed all in stock on their websites albeit at higher prices. The CSR then went and reinstated all orders at the price I ordered them and assured me of delivery since they were indeed in stock. The next day I received cancellation notices again for all the same items.  Amazon service has been going downhill.  I called Customer service again and was told there was nothing they could do. Hung up, called another CSR who said they would refund me the difference if I placed a new order. I did so and received no refund. I emailed the CSR again and this time was told they would not honor the refund EVEN THOUGH ANOTHER CSR PROMISED ME IN WRITING. They did wind up sending me the keyboard though after an additional call but I lost out on my mouse, webcam and ps3 controller due to no fault of my own. Totally unacceptable and I will not order from them again."
"This is what I wrote to Mercury News Editor today:Dear Editor,I would like to share my Amazon.com's TV orderexperience with other readers and let them know that in this digital age, things can go so bad that Amazon.com could give false reasons for the order cancellation. I placed the order late night on Dec 11, 2007. On Dec 12 early morning, I got confirmation email from the merchant that the order has been received. Soon after I got email from Amazon that the order has been cancelled. The reason given was ""out of stock"".I called the merchant (Datavision www.datavis.com) immediately to check if the TV was in stock or not. They told me that TV was indeed in stock but they cancelled the order due to Amazon.com's pricing mistake.I understand pricing mistakes happen and goodmerchants do honor their mistakes or compensatesomehow, but neither Datavision nor Amazon.com did anything about this. They just simply cancelled my order. My order does not even show up on my account on Amazon.com so I cannot even leave the feedback for the merchant. I am totally upset due to two reasons:1) False reason given to me for the order cancellation. 2) Unable to leave feedback for the merchant atAmazon.com. Is this how feedback system supposed to work at Amazon.com?I am cc'ing merchant and amazon.com so that they can correct me if I have said anything wrong in this email.Just want to share my experience with your viewers. If you need more details, you can reach me at or Thank you very much,"
"I also have difficulties with my black Friday order. I emailed them, and the only response I got is that they are sorry about my situation! Amazon didn't make any attempt to make things right. What a waste of time staying awake on Thanksgiving holiday to get the ""special price error sale."""
"Like everyone else that has commented in the past several weeks, I also got screwed by Amazon. This is clearly an abuse of their power as a major company to provide a service of selling their product to a selective few and leaving the rest of their consumers in the dark. I now tell others to avoid Amazon at all cost and choose other alternative retailers. Amazon needs to learn from Newegg about running a business."
"Regarding their customer service, I ordered the mouse that everyone has been posting about. I was told, after two emails, that they would make a one-time exception to honor the previous price and that I should place a new order. Once I place the order for the mouse at full price, they told me to email them back with the new order number for the discount.When I did, I was told that they would not be honoring their promise. I would have to pay full price (a $50 difference) because one customer service rep. decided to break the word of another.When I called to find out more information, I was told that no customer service rep. can alter a price on a product, for any reason. Hilarious in retrospect since they've been doing it for other people after my story made it to Consumerist.com. Too bad they didn't do it for me."
"   Amazon false advertises their products, using ""price mistake"" as an excuse. On Black Friday, Amazon post the Logitech MX Revolution mouse and webcam on their ""exclusive deals"" front page. A little more of a week after Black Friday, I received an email from Amazon stating that my order as been canceled due to price error. If this is price error, shouldn't Amazon have moderators monitoring the page they know that will be viewed a lot? If it is a price mistake, why does it take a week for Amazon to say its a price error and not  on the same day?  After a week of calling and emailing, I kept getting the same response: ""price error."" Then one CSR said they'll make an exception and placed the order at the price before rebates without my consent. Furious that due to the new order date meant that the rebate would be invalid, I fought for another half week complaining about the rebate. Finally, a CSR gave me the price that the order should have been after rebate. On that same day, the file I complaint was updated, with Amazon using the same ""price error"" response? What is going on here? First Amazon does not want to help me? Then they do? Then they dont and take back their word?  Amazon has seriously gone down the drain.  The company has become more and more unorganized the bigger it has become. Now Amazon is at the bottom of my list when I have to make online purchases as this Black Friday experience is one that I'll never forget. Very dissatisfied!!! DO NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON. Any company that is organized like this should fail and no longer exist."
"On black friday i ordered the logitech mx revolution mouse and logitech quickcam ultra edition. They were priced at your regular black friday prices so i figured it was a normal sale. after After a few days my other orders were shipped but these two items still had not been updated. I emailed on the estimated ship out date asking where it was and was told it was a temporary back up and my items shipping method was  upgraded and it would be sent out accordingly. The next ship date rolled around and still i received no new update so i emailed once again. I got one email saying that an item was shipped then about 3 hours later another email saying that it was a ""price mistake"" and that the items were to be canceled. After one week of waiting i got canceled yet other received their items as promised? Horrible business practice in my opinion to promise a person an item then cancel it on bogus pretenses. it took awhile and more than 5 emails to get them to honor the price. they also gave me a 80 dollar amazon credit in the place of the rebates. i would have rather of received an 80 dollar refund but at least they made an attempt to resolve the issue.revision number 2: well since amazon isn't responding to my emails currently i have to change my review back to bad. they gave me the 80 dollar refund but are now trying to not give me the PROMISED promo price that they said they would. so  i am no longer content. If/when this is resolved i change this whole rating but until then BOO amazon."
"Purchased 2 items on sale at amazon.com during Thanksgiving time. Waited for it to arrive, after 7 days got an email that the order was going to ship a little later than usual and i should be expecting it in the next 10 days. After 8 days i get another email informing me that the order was cancelled because of incorrect price. Thats ridiculous! For a gift item that i purchased for someone, why should it take 8 days for them to find out that the price was wrong? Further, a friend of mine who ordered the very same products at the very same price in an exactly similar order received the products. He was a member of Amazon Prime. So, does it mean that they treat the people differently based on whether they are or are not members of their prime club? If so, why do they allow others to purchase? Why not work as a membership only site?Within my family and me, we must have ordered products worth thousands of dollars from Amazon. But now, will never buy from Amazon.com again."
Amazon does not honor BF deals. Cop out excuse that Black Friday items were price mistakes. Yet many customers had same items shipped to them while I waited 10 days to receive a cancellation email. As result I missed out on similar deals through other etailers.
Calling their BlackFriday deals a price error. Very lame.
"I too ordered the Black Friday special Logitech wireless mouse...but Amazon decided 10 days later to cancel my order.  They have been extremely unhelpful in both email and voice customer service stating they didn't care if my order was canceled, to deal with it that they aren't doing anything.DON'T BUY AT AMAZON.COM.  BUYER BEWARE...Goto another retailer that cares about their customers and doesn't blatantly lie, advertise a special and then not honor it."
"Same thing everyone else is saying happened to me.  Order confirmed, order delayed, and finally order cancelled due to price mistake.  What a fiasco on Black Friday.  How any retailer can back track on their pricing, especially on Black Friday, makes no sense to me.  It basically took away any chance for consumers to get deals from other retailers.  Black Friday is generally a time when retailers take a small loss in profits to generate more traffic to their stores and websites.  Amazon has figured out a way to get consumers to their site, get them used to placing orders, then not actually taking that small loss that other retailers consider the cost of getting more customers."
"Amazon cancelled my order (after 10 days) and saying it was a price mistakes!  I wonder, I actually paying a competitive pricing among other web sites. I don't buy this is a price mistakes!!!   Amazon did not offer any compensations or other offers for customers who waited for 10 days for their orders!!  WARNING TO ALL BUYERS... BEWARE of low price items!!!  Go Buy.com instead!!"
"Placed order on Black Friday like many others who shopped at Amazon.  Confirmed e-mail on the purchase of two Logitech web cams.  System showed ship date of 11-28.  The ship date was later moved to 12-03.  Received an e-mail on 12-01 indicating a pricing error.  Amazon cancelled the order.I went on FatWallet.com and discovered that many had the same problem.  Only a few web cams were shipped at the advertised price.  Apparently, there was no pricing error.  I got burned again by this company.  My last three orders from Amazon over the previous two years were cancelled based on the same BS ""pricing error"" even though I received an e-mail confirmation.I called the toll-free line asking for a supervisor.  Was told there's one one supervisor on duty and he will call back.  Right!  The CSR would not provide me with her name or customer ID saying it's a company policy.Burn three times.  No more Amazon for me. Just to show how bad Amazon is as a retailer, I saw an item at NewEgg for $60 with $50 rebate and free shipping.  When added to the cart, item is listed at $80.  One call to NewEggg and the CSR issued a credit of $20 to my CC. "
"Ordered the Logitech MX Revolution mouse for the prices they advertised days before Black Friday. Ordered the products literally within minutes of the deal. Shipping estimate was on Nov. 28th. On Nov. 28th, recieved a delayed message until Dec. 3rd. Then, on Nov. 30th recieved an email saying the order was cancelled because of pricing errors. That is full of BS. THey advertise their prices, you order, they delay your order, then cancel your order. Don't buy at Amazon."
"I order the MX mouse a few minutes after the sale began. I received a confirmation email right after the sale. On 11/29/07, I recieved an email stating that my order was delayed due to shipping problems. 12/1/07, I received a notice from them due to a so called ""pricing error"" and my order was removed from my account and cancelled. There was no pricing error, the item had been advertised at 36.99 price and the manufacturer's mail in rebate should not have affected this price/been the cause of a pricing error. I was lied to, jerked around for a week, and was not compensated or given the opportunity to be compensated in anyway for THEIR mistake and bait and switch tatics. I was eventually told that the item was limited in stock and was OOS, but that doesn't explain what had happened. Several buyers who bought around the same time, before, and after me, received this item at the sale price. This is especially true of the people who were amazon prime members or who chose two day shipping. I was penalized because I didn't have enough money for either and due to their mistake.Other retailers were advertising the SAME deal for around the SAME price and did not jerk their customers around. They dishonestly strung me along and waiting on this deal keeped me from purchasing from another retailer. This is not a good business practice!! They should compensate their buyers, especially their long-term buyers like me.  I am very disappointed in you Amazon!!!!"
"I bought a mouse and a webcam on the morning of Black Friday. My credit card was charged. I got the confirmation email. Three days later I got a notification that the order would be delayed. I waited. Another 2 days later I got another email telling me that the order was canceled. I was very unhappy.Then the same thing happened to me again 2 days later. I order a USB drive, got the confirmation email, and was waiting for my order to ship. Days later I got a similar email telling me the order was canceled again! This time it's even more ridiculous because the email simply stated: your order was canceled. We are sorry.That's it for me to shop Amazon. I know you are a big company and you probably don't care about me. But heck wait to see more and more used-to-be loyal customers pissed off then it's too late. "
"Ordered an item off of Amazon on Black Friday and Amazon canceled it a week later saying that it was a ""price error"".  Many people have received the item while others' were canceled.  Amazon is such BS."
"I purchased a Logitech MX mouse and webcam on Black Friday which were canceled due to a ""price mistake"".  However:- I received a shipping delayed for the webcam on about 11/26 but then on 12/1 received an email that said that the items were canceled due to a price  mistake. (if it really was a price mistake then why did it take 8 days to find this out and why did I receive a shipping delayed email?! [the email said it would be delayed for 3 days from the original shipping estimate]- some other people who purchased the same items have received and are continuing to receive their orders. (why is Amazon selectively shipping out orders?!)- the orders were made on Black Friday and there were other retailers who had the MX mouse on sale for a similar or reasonable price on that day or soon after. (by waiting so long, Amazon has robbed me of the opportunity to purchase those items elsewhere while they were still on sale)- the purchase was made on Black Friday so the prices the items were selling for were not totally unreasonable.- my theory is that they simply sold more of the items in question on Black Friday than they had anticipated and were looking for a way to get out of it.* after emailing them with a very well thought out complaint I received a standard cut and paste response saying they could do nothing and acknowledging none of my questions!* after calling them I received the same.** In short, this experience with Amazon has left a bad taste in my mouth.  I believe that Amazon has engaged in deceptive business practices and has responded unsatisfactorily to my customer service inquires.Aside from clothes and groceries, I conduct almost all of my shopping online.  Although it is hard to avoid Amazon since they are the largest online retailer, in the future I will take my business elsewhere when a choice in retailers exist, especially with my big ticket items and products I  know will generate a high profit margin for Amazon.  If Amazon wants to nickel-and-dime us, I say we make sure Amazon loses out on our sales for at least a year so that they don't come out ahead from these order cancellations.  Also, I believe that as consumers, we have a right and responsibility to reward retailers which deal fairly and honestly with their customers by patronizing them.  Accordingly, retailers who do not respect their customers should not be allowed to continue with ""business as usual."""
"Ordered Logitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse on November the 23rd in the early morning.  I subsequently received 2 notices saying my order was ""delayed"" - no mention of there being any problems with the prices being ""incorrect"".Then, after 8 days, they cancel my order because of the 'price mistake'.  To add insult to injury, amazon did send this item to some customers...  Really disappointed."
"I understand that Amazon is a very large company, and thus they cannot personally attend to every order to ensure its proper fulfillment, but what has just happened to me is quite ridiculous. I will quickly recap.I placed an order on or around September 26, 2007 for twenty-nine children's books for my wife's kindergarten classroom for just $21. Amazon was running a 4-for-3 sale, and on top of that, many of the books were priced at a dollar or below. We were ecstatic, and even happier after we ordered enough to receive Free Super Saver Shipping.Several days later, I received an email notifying me that Amazon would be unable to fulfill my order thanks to having been ""unexpectedly out of stock in copies of one or more items that we can offer at the discounted price."" Nineteen of the books on my order at this point were cancelled. To make matters much worse, a shipping charge of $12.90 had been added to the order since it no longer totalled enough money (a matter of Amazon's own mistake, not mine), bringing the grand total for TEN books to $24, three dollars more expensive than I was previously slated to receive TWENTY-NINE books for. I was offered a $10 credit toward a future purchase, which helps to some extent, but considering that the actual adjusted price of the books is around $3-$4 apiece, that's only good for around three of the nineteen books I had lost.I was able to call and eventually have the shipping charge dropped, and so I signaled my contentedness and went on with things. Then, later, I logged on to find that further changes had been made to my order. Now, only TWO BOOKS were left on the order, and the total, including a shipping charge ONCE AGAIN, came to $8.So in summation, I went from a fantastic 29 children's books for my wife's classroom for just $21 to TWO books for $8, minus a $10 credit.Am I supposed to be content with this? At the very least I would think Amazon could seek to honor the original price quoted on just TEN of the books...I truly cannot believe Amazon changed my order once again even after the first issue we had worked out! This is ridiculous, quite frankly, and I am not the type of person who typically complains. What a joke.Amazon, I can understand that you might have made a pricing error here, and I honored your initial correction of the matter, but this is simply unnecessary. There has got to be a better way to deal with this than once again trying to charge me shipping. Now, rather than receive29 children's books for my wife's classroom for each less than a dollar, I am set to receive TWO books for roughly four dollars apiece.No thank you, I think I will simply take my business elsewhere--and YOU SHOULD TOO!This is not the first time this has happened to me or a friend/family member. Amazon readily cancels orders thanks to their policy on pricing errors and other mishaps without even so much as a compensation of some sort--regardless of how insignificant the error might have been. If you order from them, expect their system to screw you over in some fashion if there ever is a problem with your order. In my example, they tried to charge me $13 in shipping that was originally supposed to be waived, and that was AFTER they cancelled about half of the items in my order. They can and will do the same thing to you--it happens literally all the time. DO NOT order from Amazon without watching your order like a hawk, and be prepared to do your shopping all over again somewhere else if by some chance something goes wrong (which happens more than you might think)."
Amazon cancelled my order stating a pricing error.  They seem to do this quite frequesntly lately
"I ordered Logitech MX mouse at 3:00 AM EST on black friday 11/23. After pushing the shipment dates for 10 days Amazon finally cancelled the order saying that it was a price mistake. Because I had placed the order with amazon , I didn't place order for Logitech VX on cyber monday from tigerdirect (Free after mail in rebate) and amazon ($7 after mail in rebate). I wanted to have nice mouse on black friday and due to stupid amazon, I don't have any, though other websites did offer very good deals on these. I would never do any business with Amazon and would recommend everyone NOT TO DO ANY BUSSINESS WITH AMAZON."
"Amazon is a perfect example of screwing customers during holiday shopping. 1) they advertise good deals on the website and lure you into it. 2) they sent an email a few days later claiming it is delayed but kept you hope open. 3) they finally sent you an email and said order cancelled due to price error. Come on, even it is just an error, it is just about $10 or so. What is the big deal for Amazon to make customers happy instead of screwing them like this? I could have bought it at other places if there is not that deceptive delay notice but now all the deals are gone and I got nothing.Please remember, if you want to buy something as a gift, never buy it from amazon.com. It won't deliver and you will feel being tricked by their ""smart"", or should I say ""mean"", customer service.actually I won't even buy anything from them. Frys.com, newegg.com, buy.com all do better than Amazon and typically offers better deals."
"Just like most people out there, I ordered the Logitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse and the Logitech QuickCam Communicate Deluxe on Black Friday, but after waiting a week they delayed my orders and then canceled both of them due on a lame reason ""Price Mistake""?!? What kind of that excuse is? Just because they didn't expect so many orders, and couldn't make money out of that, and canceled everyone orders by a lame excuse?!PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM AMAZON, ESPECIALLY ON BLACK FRIDAY!!!"
 I ordered Logitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse and Logitech QuickCam Communicate Deluxe on black friday. They sent an email after a week that there is a delay in delivery. Then after 2 days my order was cancelled by amazon saying it was a price mistake on black friday Ad.  Never buy anything from Amazon.com. They advertise products for cheaper price just to get the server hit and cancel the order later.
"I placed an order of Logitech MX Revolution mouse for $36.99 on 11/23/2007. I got an Amazon email on 11/30/2007, stating that there is a delay of shipping. However, another Amazon email received on 12/1/2007 notified me that the order is cancelled due to a pricing error. This is very strange because the price was only $3 less than that advertised by Amazon. I can accept the price increase by $3 instead of cancelling. Please note that other customers got cancellation email as early as 11/25/2007. You will ask why Amazon still sent me a shipping-delay email on 11/30/2007. I believe this is their trick of getting off the transaction contract. So this is a very bad business practice that Amazon uses its legal cover of so-called pricing error to get away from the transaction contract. People, do not buy anything from such a bad retailer."
"Absolutely Horrendous!Ordered the following on Black Friday, after staying up till 3am waiting for their advertised sale. Item was in stock and ready for shipping long after I ordered. Waited a week only to get an email after my original delivery date, saying it will be delayed for a week. Only to get another email saying they will not be honoring their Black Friday advertised sale.This is not what I expect from a reputable online company. I will never do business with Amazon again! Stay away! Shipping estimate for these items: November 28, 2007	1 	""Logitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse""Electronics; $36.99  Sold by: Amazon.comScrewed by: Amazon.com  "
"Amazon has completely screwed another long time customer with shoddy business tactics and horrible customer service! During last months Black Friday advertised deals, they offered some Logitech computer peripherals at a discounted price. Yes, I'm talking about the Logitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse! It wasn't until about a week later that I was informed that they would not be able to ship me my item because of a supposed pricing error on their website... HOGWASH! Now I'm out of luck due to Amazon ignorance and incompetence. I've yet to receive any type of compensation for their inconsiderations!"
"I am really dissatisfied with Amazon.com's consumer service regarding this order.  I am certain that this product was not a price mistake because it was part of Amazon's Black Friday sale and that thousands of customers have ordered this product for the same price. I am aware of this fact because I have read hundreds of online bargain forums which stated this product was indeed selling at this price by Amazon.com and that the majority has already received their orders.  I was really looking forward to receiving this order and after almost two weeks and three emails later I get a cancellation email!?  I do not believe that Amazon.com is so incompetent that it took so long to caught this ""price mistake.""  I have also ordered the Logitech VX laser mouse from Amazon during it's Cyber Monday sale for about the same price as this product and it has already shipped. I have been a loyal and frequent costumer at Amazon and have been very satisfied with all of my previous purchases, but now I will be hesitant to make future purchases because of this terrible experience. How can I trust a company that can backtrack their way out of things by simply sending ""We regret to inform you that an error caused the following item(s) to be displayed at an incorrect price:Logitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser MouseIn accordance with our posted policies on pricing, we are unable tooffer this item for the incorrectly posted price. Therefore, we havecancelled your order for this item,"" when I know that this is not true. I am seriously considering reporting this awful experience to the Better Business Bureau because I am so displeased right now. I hope I am the only one that was so unlucky to have this happen to me because I know they will be extremely dissatisfied as well if this was the case."
"Very dissatisfied. Amazon canceled my Quickcam deluxe after saying that their promotional BF price was an error. After talking to the CSR, even the ESR, they refused to accept their mistakes. I have filed a complain with BBB. "
"I am VERY DISSATISFIED!Both my orders has also been cancelled for the Logitech MX Mouse and Logitech Quickcam Communicate Deluxe webcam.Just received the famous e-mails today.This is BS, yesterday I received an e-mail from Amazon.com to approve a later delivery time for my products which I did approve.Amazon.com $@$@ us all. On BF I saw so many awesome Webcam and Mouse deals from other companies after ordering from Amazon.com.but I didnt get them, because I already ordered both the webcam and mouse already from Amazon.com and I was one of the first ones to order them.Now my friend has a VX (which I gave him the link for) and now I dont have anything. The VX was super low priced too from Office Depot I believe it was or maybe Staples, anyways I wish I went for the VX instead of trusting in Amazon.com for my MX."
"My problem with Amazon.com is very similar to  	kwonster's. Amazon.com is very dishonest and has a very unfair business practice. People who paid extra for shipping got their orders at Amazon's ""mistaken price."" Others who chose free shipping did not get their orders but instead got a notice lying to them by claiming it was a ""price error"" a whole WEEK later. I'm quite surprised it took Amazon a week to realize a ""price error"" after shipping out a number of orders. "
"I used to shop at Amazon because they had the lowest price, but lately the service shows how they get that price. They had a heavily advertised item on black friday for a great price. However, after shipping out several units for people who paid extra for next day shipping, they delayed shipping for everyone who got standard or free shipping. Why? So a week later they can cancel the orders saying ""We regret to inform you that an error caused the following item(s) tobe displayed at an incorrect price:Logitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser MouseIn accordance with our posted policies on pricing, we are unable tooffer this item for the incorrectly posted price. Therefore, we havecancelled your order for this item.""That's one way to get people to shop at your store, let a couple people willing to pay extra for the item, then screw everyone else over. And no, it isn't a pricing error. It was a way to get people to visit their site instead of going to a store on black friday like everyone else. I wouldn't be this pissed if they hadn't drawn it out so long. First there is a letter claiming there is a ""delay"" in shipping until Dec 11-12, and then a week later another letter saying it is cancelled. WAY TO STRING US ALONG! THANKS FOR THE GREAT SERVICE!"
"WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD WITH AN E-MERCHANT !!!On October 15th I ordered a CE Labs video distribution amplifier, which included free shipping. The Web page stated the shipper was Antonline.com and the product was NEW.Received the order on Oct. 19th, but it was an obviously used, open-box item, sent from the Amazon merchandise returns department -- not a new one from Antonline, as the Web page still stated!Emailed Amazon CS about this and they were very apologetic; they agreed to X-ship a NEW one right away and issued free return shipping for the used one.Close to a week later what did I receive? ANOTHER USED ONE FROM THE AMAZON RETURNS CENTER !!! (No, this was not the one I was supposed to return. Still had it.)Emailed Amazon CS AGAIN; got connected to a chain of out-sourced CS agents from India who were very confused and not very helpful. At one point they told me I couldn't request another RMA because I bought a bed frame set with the same order... where the H did THAT impression come from??? I had never ordered a bed frame.At this point I had two used video amps and had been charged for one NEW one. Amazon refused to assist me further until I had returned both amps to them. They gave me a 30-day deadline from the first order to do so, or they'd charge my Visa the NEW price for the other USED amp.Sent everything back. About two weeks later, I get an email from them acknowledging receipt of the first amp, but not the second one returned at the same time. They went on to write that since I still have the second one, they won't refund my $$$. I had enough at that point...I contacted my bank to do a credit reversal and launch a formal investigation into Amazon's fraudulent advertising of this amp as being NEW and being shipped by Antonline. Later, on the same day Amazon sent me an email apologizing for this latest screw up and announced I'd be credited the original purchase price ASAP! (They also quickly removed the fraudulent evidence from their Web site -- even though I'd already saved the page for my records weeks ago.) I did eventually receive the credit I was due...Beware of electronic items advertised as NEW with free shipping -- Amazon will probably send you someone else's RMA...    Will I ever again attempt to order ANYTHING from Amazon? I DON""T THINK SO !!!"
"Amazon is really bad for APO users living overseas.  Half the stuff I try to order comes back with ""sorry, we can't send this to an APO"".  I then go to other reputable websites like newegg.com, bhphoto.com, cvs.com, or jr.com, and they gladly send the exact same product to me.  I work exclusively in US Embassies overseas, and tell my fellow diplomats that they should use Amazon.com only as a last resort.  The rest of the internet market has no problem sending me the items I need, but Amazon obviously feels that they make enough money already and don't need the business of several thousand foreign service Americans.  Too bad, as the other companies have no problem supporting Americans working on behalf of America overseas."
"I would have never throught it possble, but they tried to steal $16 from me.  I placed an order for $30 (subtotal was $46, but I got $16 credit for slow/free shipping).  Product was backordered, so they told me to wait. Few months later I check the status of my order and find out that I had ""returned"" the items and was issued a refund of $30 - $16 = $14.  Only problem is that I never even got the item.Basically, I pay them $30, they cancel my order without informing me and give me $14 back."
Order still not received even though I paid for expedited shipping.  Slow order processing. Slow delivery.  No communication.  No meaningful customer support.  Slut a bunch of wheezeballs!
"It's the third time Amazon shipped an opened-box and damaged item to me.  I am shopping for a NEW item, and the merchant is Amazon itself.  They refused to give me a replacement because I want them to ship it to Canada without charging me shipping and custom again (I already paid custom the first time).  End up I am getting a discount from them.  I just couldn't believe why such a big online retailer can keep shipping craps to their loyal customers."
"Item did not ship on scheduled date, I upgraded to 2 day shipping, yet the item is estimated for arrival on Oct 31st, it was picked up on the 26th, hardly 2 day shipping. The customer service is definitly not located in the United States and appeared to lack the ability to address any form of problem other than apologizing for their delays.Price wasn't good enough to justify the small amount of savings for state sales tax.If you want an apology for having a very common item at MSRP several days/weeks late then by all means purchase from Amazon.com, however if you want something on time, buy it anywhere else."
"Amazon is one of those companies that is great IF you do not have any problems. If problems arise, prepare yourself for long strings of canned email responses from overseas CSRs, who apparently have no comprehension of the subtle nuances of the English language. I pre-ordered a cd that was due to release on 10/23 in early Septemver. Previously Amazon had a policy that stated you would get the cd the day it was release, they have retracted this policy. In my case I did not get it on the 23rd but late on the 24th I did get a letter saying it was delayed so my shipping date was pushed back. Now I will get the cd but not until five days after it is in stores. There deal specifically states that they will ship with whatever method necessary to meet the projecte delivery date of the 26th. This wouldhave meant that they would have to next day it, vice 2nd day, to make sure it made it. They did not do this and keep responding with things like 'Good news! I tracked it and it is on the way!"" Give me a break.Next time I will just buy it from the store and forget about amazon and their outsourced 'customer service'."
"Ordered an expensive item that had a rebate error, listed as having twice the actual rebate.  Found out after shipment of the item that it was an error and when I called about it, all they told me was that I could return it, they would not honor the rebate error price.  I spent the next 3 weeks being told the same thing over and over by email and phone that I would get a pre-paid mailing label to ship back, but all I could find (even with ""direct"" links sent to me) was a mailing label with the return address.  Finally, on my 6th attempt to contact Amazon about this, a half hour call on the phone with a CSR told me I'd have to pay the shipping cost myself and call in for a refund.  Well, after I ship and call back for refund, they tell me they have no idea what I'm talking about but they'll ""do it because that's what another CSR said.""  Are these guys trained in there job or do they just make it up as they go??  This has been the worst experience I've ever had ordering an item online, makes me think twice about ordering again from Amazon, at least for high-cost items.  My previous experiences have been good with Amazon, but this one has been bad enough to change my thoughts about them."
"Cancel order, amazon claims store must issue refund, store claims amazon must issue refund.I am out 197.00 and amazon keeps replying with the same canned email that the seller  issues refund and doesn't address the issue at all"
"I paid $1698 for a brand new Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM.  Amazon shipped me a used lens and unprotected packing, I complained to Amazon customer service and asking for a replacement.  They have not respond to my request."
Even though I paid extra for standard shipping it still took 8 business days to ship two in-stock items in two separate shipments. Shipping was lightening quick from Amazon a few years ago and now it's unbearably slow. 
"I've placed almost 20 orders with Amazon since 2005, never had any problem. Very fast shipping, good packaging. Have yet to call Customer Service.Only negative is that the items NOT sold directly from Amazon.com appear to not combine on shipping, plus you might get into some shady dealers with a bad reputation. I try to only buy directly from the Amazon.com inventory.*update*On order #21, they d*cked me over. GJ amazon, just lost another customer."
"Beware: Buy the Amazon Kindle, and you become a prisoner of DRM (Digital Restrictions Management) forever, and worse, you will lock the entire business world into this Draconian swindle.Search: Kindle SwindleI changed my mind, and did not buy the Kindle Swindle, but the world needs to know just how horrid this swindle scheme is.Amazon I am ashamed of you!Thanks for the many who pointed out to me the horrors of what this will do if Amazon becomes the premier business model for DRM.  You WILL NOT take away my rights to do with a book what I WANT!Do not buy the Kindle Swindle from Amazon!"
"My first major purchase with Amazon and what a disaster. I ordered a 47” LCD television and received an email that my 42” television was on backorder. I immediately called Amazon and they told me not to worry that the generated message was probably wrong. Yea Right!! I checked with the vendor’s site to confirm my order. Yep! I paid for a 47” LCD television but the shipping invoice was a different model with a 42” screen. Furious, I called Amazon again, they said that the product is not Amazon merchandise so I will have to deal with the vendor. Absolutely no support from Amazon and I am currently out $1500!! Amazon a day later after my purchase sells this Toshiba TV as Amazon merchandise and they still won’t help me. Ouch!  Talk about insult to injury!!"
For whatever reason this order from amazon has taken longer than usual. What usually takes about 3 days is going to take me over a week. I am annoyed that I'm paying full price for an item and shipping yet still get slow shipping. 
"I tried to cancel this order before it was shipped. Customer service said I couldn't because the order went to their ""fulfillment center"" and could not be stopped. The order has not yet shipped, and yet is impossible to stop. WTF! I've never heard a more ridiculous excuse. I've had countless orders canceled by amazon without notice, and now the one small order I have I can't even cancel! This is going to be the last purchase amazon ever gets from me. "
"I ordered through Amazon an Mastercool infrared thermometer MAS52226-A-SP at a very attractive price.  The merchant providing the item was HandsOnTools. On 8/10/07 Amazon confirmed the order; on 8/13 HandsOnTools confirmed order.  On 8/17 Amazon notified me that the merchant was not going to ship, because it was out of stock.  The merchant however, shortly thereafter started advertising the item for a much higher price.  Amazon states that they frown on this practice, and furnish other platitudes, but no other satisfaction.  Basically a customer can not back out of an order, but a merchant can.  I will think twice before doing business with Amazon."
"So I guess Amazon.com has a policy of requiring a signature on delivery for orders over $420.  This is terrible because many people cannot just stay home for a day to receive a package, especially when the arrival time is not specified.  I've ordered from other companies that do not require a signature on these packages.  This means I'll not be ordering packages over $420 from Amazon.com anymore.Thanks for causing such an inconvenience.  Somebody needs to wake up and realize if people can't GET THEIR PACKAGES THEY WON'T SHOP WITH YOU ANYMORE.  Dummies."
"I was extremely irate with amazon with my last purchuse. I'm a photographer and needed a flash by a certain date; when the falsh arrived it was for the wrong type of camera even though the invoice and the reciept and everything but the actual flash said it was for my brand camera and when I called amazon to get it straightened out they completely questioned me about it!! And here the lady didn't even no what ""So."" in my address meant. Ridiculous. They can't ship it any faster than ground and I'll have to wait another 2 weeks aproximate delivery from the location it's at. No other shipping options. I will recieve the flash a whole month after I ordered it. And have to go through the hassle of returning the initial incorrect item. I'm still irritated. Last Time ever for amazon! "
"Amazon was so far my favorite online store until this last purchase - it was totally a scam!They advertised this Logitech Z-5300e THX-certified 280-Watt 5.1 Surrond Sound PC and Gaming Speaker System to have a $40 rebate, plus any order above $25 can have a Free super saver option.I placed the order on 8/12/2007, and was told my order is an ""extra heavy item"" and thus needed to pay $20 for shipping, which is false as of today, 8/17/2007 which they now offer FREE shipping!OK that's my fault of ordering it too early! But when I try to claim my rebate, they simply have no such option for the item I've ordered and provide nothing at all!? Am I dreaming at the time I placed the order? But they still said on their site there IS a $40 REBATE!? What a false statement!!I just tried to contact Amazon to figure out what's going on, but still feel unfair to be treated this way. I'll update my status to see if they'd change the way of doing business.Just found out Logitech did really offer a $40 rebate but have to purchase thru CLT/Mwave. They just request a $18.85 shipping charge, plus CA tax which is still cheaper than Amazon, let alone the extra $40 from Logitech. Seems like Amazon exploited my 8 years faith with them...stupid me...rest of shoppers just be alert!! "
"Slow delivery speed. Poor customer service. I have made multiple purchases from amazon.com over the past few years mostly due to the price as compared to other online sellers. The problem with Amazon is the shipping times. I have tried standard and the free super saving shipping and both take over a week from time of purchase to receipt in mail. Currently, I purchased software using the super saver shipping, and it has been 5 days since the date of purchased and it is still listed as ""not mailed yet."" The to be shipped date estimate is 6 days after the purchase date and the delivery estimate is at 7 to 13 days beyond the shipping date (7-13 days in the hands of the shipping service provider). So expect to receive your package 13-19 days after you purchased your order. The standard shipping appears also to take about 5 days before the product is actually even shipped. I find this ridiculous because other online stores usually ship that day or the next, then it is up to the shipping service provider. I have not tried their 1day or 2day shipping options because the added price makes the order no longer worth it, since the it would be cheaper and quicker to purchase the product from the store. Also the last purchase was received poorly packaged without proper filling so the DVD box set was crushed. "
"I am buying from one state where I have a 2nd home while my billing address is another state.  In ordering from Amazon.com I expected the screen would show the address I wanted the item shipped to.  Did not happen.  ""Thank you for your order"" came the message.  There is a button that says ""Edit order"" so I clicked.  A notice came up saying that it was too late to edit.  So, I have an order being shipped to my main residence where there is no one to accept it.  Funny, Amazon can track ever purchase I ever made and send me notices about things I might be interested in but they can not allow me to put in the correct address 15 seconds later.  It is so typical of their disregard for their customers.  No wonder they have such a low rating here and at other sites.  People are giving up on Amazon.  I certainly have.  Today's order was my last."
"Ordered a digital camera on July 12th, standard shipping (3 to 5 days). The camera was shipped on the 12th, it arrived on July 23rd. I paid $6.76 for 11 day shipping. The package was shipped USPS parcel post. Parcel post is the slowest way to ship anything in the US.Packaging was a joke. There was one small air bag to cushion the camera box as it tumbled in the shipping container for 11 days. This is, by far, the worst experience I've had with an internet purchase.I now understand why Amazon's rating on this site is below average.AMAZON has become a 2ND RATE company. Never again. "
"AMAZON.COM SUCKS!  I tried to place an order and use a Bank debit card and a regular credit card.  They only accept one at time of purchase.  The customer service rep (locaed in ASIA) suggested I purchase a gift certificate with one card and then apply that towards my purchase instead.  Well I followed their instructions and bought a gift certificate with the bank debit card only to ahve it declined for insufficient funds (they charged me a extra dollar so I didn't have enough money on the card).  They then tell me that it is fixed and give a $10 purchase credit that the rep. said I could use for a gift certificate.  Guess what, you can't.  Now I am out $2.00 and still no f***ing gift certifiacte.  I have been in contact with them a total of 6 times on the phone (total of 5 hours), multiple e-mails, and do you know what I got--u-gots, nothing, nada, zip, zilch.  Not even my refund of $2.00.  F*** AMAZON.COM!  P.S. it took them over two weeks to issue the refund and then had the audacity to tell me they never charged me in the first place.  DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!!!!!"
"Ugh. This is by far the worst experience I've ever had in the 7 or so years I've been shopping at Amazon. It's so nice to know that they can turn round and casually shaft their repeat customers without a care in the world.This particular order was for a little over $200 of miscellaneous stuff. Part of the order was for a couple of SD flash cards, which I figured (correctly) we would need for an upcoming holiday.The order was placed in plenty of time, but Amazon decided to wait a week before informing me that part of the order was delayed. By the time the cards shipped, there was no way they would be able to make it here before we left, and as a result I had to run to a local Best Buy the night before the trip to buy replacements.After we got back, after consulting with customer service I refused the package when the post office tried to deliver it. This is supposed to be an acceptable method of a return with Amazon.This evening I received an email with details of the return and the refund. Instead of the full $36 refund amount, Amazon then had the nerve to:1. Deduct from that some $5 for the use of a prepaid shipping label that they claim was used in the return (it wasn't),2. Deduct the amount quoted as saved for free shipping (despite a policy that if the return is due to their error, no such deduction will be made),3. Perform the elementary school math so badly in subtracting the two deductions that the final amount is far less than what the simple sum would otherwise come out to if someone competent had done it. Perhaps Amazon needs a calculator? They have pages and pages of 'em listed on their site, so it shouldn't be too hard to find one.I have written back to customer service contesting the whole thing, but I'm not going to bother waiting for their reply to post this writeup. This whole transaction went badly enough before they tried to pull this nonsense, and this is simply the final straw.Amazon, don't expect me to order anything from you again. This farce you dare to call a refund is bordering on criminal, and I'll get the remaining funds back from my credit card company if need be.Edit: one of their reps wrote back to me and (in less than apologetic tones and with no explanation for the discrepancies) promised the full refund. The review still stands - this has been the worst experience I've ever had with Amazon."
"I've ordered at Amazon.com several times and always been satisfied. Once I ordered from Amazon France while I was in Italy. No problem at all.However, the only time I made a ""big"" order (a latex mattress, ~600$), I decided to pay giving them my bank account number rather than use my credit card as I usually do when I buy online.Wish I never done it! I made a typo entering my bank information. Amazon accepted the order but after few day, when my error came out, they suspended my account and put my case to a debt collection agency, without even dare to ask me a question. The agency charged me 25$ only to treat me like a half delinquent, harassing me, claiming they could report my name in the list of ""bad guys"" who checks are not accepted in any store... a nightmare... I understand the error in first was mine, but the story showed me how much Amazon care about their customers. Never had a problem, but the first mistake you are out. Notice my account is still suspended, after more than one year from this issue. Not that I want to make any more business with them anyway..."
"I purchase a set of very nice new earbuds from Amazon.com who apparently was selling these for Digital Media Source.  After paying for express shipping to get to me before I go out of town I expected to have great service from them and to this point it was suitable.  Once the package was inteh post offices hands they royally just messed this whole transactions up.  Keep in mind I said post office, they could not use something with tracking like UPS or FedEx.  The post office supposedly delivered it to me, at my office where someone at the front desk signed for it as I was told by the post man himself.  Though he can not tell me who out of 2 people or produce a signature since he professed they signed for it.  I have turned my front office upside down to call the post office and the post master tell me I have not looked.  At this point I try to contact amazon for assistance since the combination of them and Digital Media were the shippers.  They just passed me off that they could do nothing and Digital Media can not even return an email since they do not post a contact number.  Amazon was the company that I paid through and the name on my card statement one of the two need to step up as a business and assist with this.  At this point after calling amazon for the second time and ""Our systems are going through an upgrade and are down for several hours"" as I was told I am going to my bank to rectify this since no one involved seems to care if a customer is satisifed.  Watch out for Amazon and pay close attention on where your package is actually coming from.  I highly suggest going else where to buy any sort of small electronics, you might pay more but it is well worth it not to have the headaches or spend the time on the phone or web trying to locate your package.  Triple team efforts to ruin a sell way to go Amazon, Digital Media Source, and the USPS."
"Amazon has drifted away from quality service. They ship items without proper packaging which results in damaged goods. Even though it is easy to return items, the fact that one has to even try is not a good business practice. 4 out of 5 orders I made in the past month have ended up damaged. No matter what type of shipping method I use, the boxes arrive either opened or crushed on one side. UPS and other companies would never allow packages that can collapse on the top lid if pushed down with one hand. But somehow Amazon seems to be an exception. They ship boxes without foam packing or air bladders to protect the contents. A baby can easily press down on Amazon boxes that ship out to customers.C'mon Amazon. We love your fast service and huge selection but let it arrive to your customers' home intact and new. Not like it is used and abused."
I TRIED to make a purchase during amazon's big toy sale. WHAT A JOKE! I have set up a petition for customers who have had the same experience or similar with this store. Please take a moment to read and sign it! don't let them keep getting away with this nonsense! THANKS!!http://www.petitiononline.com/scamazon/petition.htmlPLEASE SIGN AND PASS ALONG! THANKS!!
"Horrible ... Horrible ... Horrible store. I am a regular online buyer and have not seen this degraded service ever. They put up some things on sale on their site and I bought them, got a confirmation email too. Then after waiting 5 days I decided to just check the status, and to my surprise the girl told me the order is on hold as the billing address was not correct. What a JOKE, I’ve used the same credit card for years to buy stuff for thousands of dollars. But she forwarded the case to the billing. Today I get an email saying that the order is canceled, without any explanation why. I called back to check and another ""informed"" rep says that the order was canceled but does not have a reason no can she put me to anyone who can give me a reason. She says I can put the order again but will not get the same discounted price, and then it struck me what's going on. They are horrible merchants and 1st grade liars. Buyers beware on buying discounted stuff. Stay away from these SNEAKY LIARS ...."
"I received the package that was supposed to contain my Adobe CS3 Design Premium upgrade today. I opened it to find it only contained a Flash CS3 professional upgrade. I’ll be sure to not buy software that costs $600 from Amazon again, you would think with such a price tag they could check the box that they were shipping to me. It wasn't a simple mistake such as getting the Standard and Premium CS3 packages switched which only have a single word different. But, the package I received clearly has FLASH CS3 PROFESSIONAL printed on it. I purchased from Amazon because they offered the CS3 upgrade for $10 cheaper, I'll be sure to not make the mistake of buying software from them in the future."
"On March 5, 2007, I ordered a new MacBook Pro 15.4"" 2.16GHz Core 2 Duo notebook from Amazon, with overnight shipping for $2003.98 worth of gift certificate funds.  A couple of weeks later, I started getting kernel panics all of the time, so I took it down to the Apple store.  I was told there that it was most likely a bad motherboard, which was a common issue, that would be fixed under AppleCare, but it would take about a week to fix, so the Genius encouraged me to return it for replacement to Amazon.  After saving all of my things, I packed it up and sent it back to Amazon.  A week later, my gift certificate balance rose to $1446.00, $557.98 was missing.  I contacted Amazon, and they told me that since the funds expired during the time I had the notebook, there was nothing they could do.  However, since they had never told me this in the first place, I decided to contact the BBB.About two weeks after contacting the BBB, I recieved an email that because I had returned so many things to Amazon, my account was now closed and I was now out any funds on my account.It is true that I had returned two of these notebooks before, but they really did have issues.  One had a bad chip of memory on the graphics card, which would cause corruption in 3D applications, and the other had issues with I/O, mainly IR communication, both of which were hardware issues, and vital to the opearation of the computer. After this fiasco, I'm perfectly fine with no longer shopping at Amazon, even after being a customer since around 1997, but being out over $2000 is a HUGE problem."
"BAD, HORRIBLE customer service!!! This is ridiculous!!!I always bought stuff from Amazon for several years now. These last couple of days though, all they gave me were headaches. I preordered two copies of an online game, and was eligible to receive two bonus keys for them. I only got one, and had to go through some email messages and only got my rightfully owned second key the following afternoon. I already knew I would order a third copy of the game for a friend of mine, so I asked Amazon in advance about how to proceed and they replied that all I had to do was preorder normally and send an email asking for the third bonus key. Guess what... not only did they NOT give me my third key, but they LOCKED my account, because some stupid worker in there thinks I am 'up to something' or something like that! WAY TO GO! Amazon just lost one honest and faithful customer. GREAT SERVICE HUH"
"On Feb 1, 2007, I placed an order for a Braun Oxyjet 8900 electric toothbrush + oral irrigator with Amazon.com.  First they told me on Feb 21 that my order would be delayed, and delivered by Mar 23.  On Mar 19 they notified me that my order was delayed again.  No explanation was given.  There is no shortage of this product on the US market, so I don't understand why they keep delaying.  Today I finally canceled my Amazon order and ordered it from a different company, who shipped promptly.  In the future, I will try to avoid Amazon."
"I have had several problems with Amazon. I only placed an order with them again recently because someone sent me a giftcard. One thing they do is say that an item usually ships in 2-3 for example but once you place your order it gives a ship dates sometimes 2-3 weeks out; I dont like that. I placed an order for a humidifier that showed it was in stock.  2 days after placing my order I got an email saying the product was on backorder and it would be at least a month before they might even have it, and if not they would automatically cxl my order. They shouldnt be telling customers a product is in stock ready to ship if it isnt. Also, their customer service people dont understand English very well & since they dont list a phone number to call them directly here it is for anyone who needs to call them courtesy of gethuman.com US Customer ServicePhone toll-free in the US and Canada: (800) 201-7575Phone from outside the US and Canada: (206) 346-2992 or (206)-266-2992Another direct line: (206) 266-2335*UPDATE* I received my last order earlier than expected. Good job Amazon now keep it up!"
Pre-ordered a book with free shipping. When the book came into stock they didn't ship it and are claiming it will ship sometime over the next two months!! What is the point of pre-ordering an item if they won't ship it to you when it comes into stock? I canceled my order and ordered it from Bookpool instead. Amazon's service has got very sloppy over the past year or two.
Amazon free shipping is a complete joke.  It take a month to ship my items.  Now I have to plan a month ahead if I need to order something from them.  What a pain...
"The free super saver shipping is an absolute joke.  Ordered an in stock item 2 days before Christmas, didn't get it till the END of January.Recently placed 2 other orders with Amazons ""partners"" for audio CD's.....both said the item would ship the next day.  It's now a week later and neither has shipped. "
"Customer Service Repeatedly Lied to Me!I ordered a sale item from Amazon and they ran out.   Fair enough.  They sent me a notice asking me to approve a delayed shipping date.  I did so.  A month later I get an email that since I didn't confirm the delayed ship date they have cancelled my order.  I email them and say no, I did approve the delay.  They say no you didn't. I am getting steamed and email them back again.At that point the CSR admits that yes I did confirm the delay, but they were not going to send it to me.Lying to customers is terrible business.  I have ordered thousands of dollars of books and other merchandise from Amazon, but never again."
"UPDATE 1/20/2007: No sooner had I entered my review about the delays in getting my book, than I got another 'your order has been delayed' email, extending the delivery estimate until March 2007 (3 to 3+1/2 months from initial order). I immediately called customer service to inquire how people who sign up for premier membership can get the book in 2 days -- yet I have to wait yet again. The C/S rep was very blunt and explained to me this was one of the benefits of getting a premier membership. And so, I immediately cancelled the order. I will be terminating my Amazon Visa immediately as well. Never will I do business with them again. INITIAL REVIEW 1/19/2007: Placed an order for the book ""The Champion Within"" on December 2. Seven weeks have passed and the book STILL HAS NOT SHIPPED!!!!! When I ordered, it was anticipated to be delivered early January. It's now January 20, I still don't have the book -- yet Amazon is giving them away FREE if I sign up for a $79 premier Amazon membership! ""Through this special promotional offer, you'll get all of the following:- The Champion Within: FREE - Two-Day Shipping: FREE (continental U.S. only, restrictions apply)""So if I cough up $80 bucks, I can have the book in two days -- but if I pay the advertised retail price, maybe I'll be lucky to have it in two months??? When I ordered it, the 'usually ships in' time was 3-4 weeks. It's now advertised at 4-6 weeks -- yet as stated above -- pony up the premier bucks and you can have it in two days.No thanks, Amazon. I'll take my business elsewhere. If only Amazon treated their customers like Newegg..."
"I have ordered numerous items from this seller in the past, and have had a good-great experience.  This past Christmas however, I feel that they have turned quite greedy.  I placed an almost $300.00 order well before Christmas(November 21), and also picked the super saver shipping.  My advice to all is BEWARE OF THIS SHIPPING!  As of January 6, 2007 more than half of my order has yet to be shipped, even though Amazon says most of it is in stock.  It is hard for me believe that for an entire month they didn't have any of the items that I ordered.  A few days after Christmas I received 1 pair of tongs.  I emailed customer service, where I was told that since I picked super saver shipping, I am automatically put in a category where my items have to be shipped in as few orders as possible.  Understandable, but apparently they can ship out one pair of tongs and not 4-5 other items that appear to be in stock?  Also, the tongs where in a box about 5 times bigger than the item. Seems like a waste of money, better put towards shipping out items in a timely fashion. BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY- they take advantage of super saver shipping option to lure in customers,then appear to take care of other customers first."
"AVOID!!  How many times am I gonna have to get burned by these losers before I finally learn my lesson?  I thought I was smarter than this, but I guess not.You've all read all the negative comments here about this outfit - maybe you're smarter than I am. Amazon is great for reading customer reviews about products, but that's about it - just don't order anything from 'em!In my latest episode, they indicated an item was in-stock, let me order, then informed me almost two days later after the order was placed that the item was in fact out-of-stock.  Thanks!If you can't take a hint, you'd sure better learn how to pray if you order from this bunch - I've gotten items that were obviously open-box and not brand new as indicated, and I've received items that I was *amazed* arrived in one piece because of the lousy packing job.They will tell you most anything to court your business, then lower the boom.  And that routine of hounding you to death on your personal page with ""HERE'S what you need to buy,"" - that got old after about two seconds.km5er's comment below says it all - read it carefully and you'll get a good idea how the drill works.AVOID!!  AVOID!!  AVOID!!"
"I needed a special backpack for a trip and when I found it at Amazon.com it was advertised that it was in Stock, being sold directly from Amazon and that if I ordered within the next 9 hours it could be delivered next day.  So I ordered and received a confirmation e-mail.  I checked the site and it was scheduled to be delivered Dec. 29. I checked the site at least ten times till about 9:30 AM on the 29th the site stated delivery Jan. 2. I received no e-mail regarding this.  I cancelled the order disappointed.  If you look the item up online Dec. 29 it still states one day shipping with delivery on Jan.2  Why would they have a problem with my order when if ordered the day after me it still offers gurantee one day delivery?  I thought I was safe because it stated ""from Amazon"" and not a third party vender and because they have only a limited number of items that they offer one day delivery and each item has a countdown timer that tells how long you have to order in order to receive the item on time.  I guess the poor ratings shown for Amazon are accurate. I have ordered small stuff that was not time critical since 2002.  I doubt I will count on Amazon.com again.  "
"PLEASE CONSIDER AMAZON.COM'S RATING BEFORE ORDERING. I ordered three Christmas presents from amazon.com, not one of their resellers who are MORE reliable than they are! Ordered on Sunday, the last day of ""FREE SUPER-SAVER SHIPPING"" for the holidays, with an estimated arrival date of Dec. 22, the Friday before Christmas. I knew that delivery was not guaranteed on that date, but I figured it would be okay. After not receiving the package, I called DHL, who informed me that THEY NEVER RECEIVED THE PACKAGE! Amazon says DHL must not have scanned it, but in any case they both agree that it is FLOATING AROUND SOMEWHERE. Amazon put in a replacement order, with two-day shipping I might add, to arrive three days after Christmas. A very poor experience overall."
Ordered several items last week with order split into two shipments by Amazon. After several days I received e-mails that my credit card could not be processed. I refreshed the order payment and half the order was accepted but still card problems on the rest. So I tried to find out how to contact customer service to find out why the problems. This is my biggest issue. While they state on their help page that contacting customer service is easy it is NOT so. They keep the contact info well hidden. When I finally did get through I received a reply that everything had been fixed. Right. I then received additional e-mail that the card was still a problem and that the order was going to be canceled (I've been using the card elsewhere though without issues). This is for the birds. So I canceled the rest of the order. Another issue with customer service is that you cannot reply to their e-mail so there can be no back-and-forth to solve a problem. I will have to think twice before ordering through them again due  to the poor customer service.
"I ordered books on December 6 to be shipped overseas. Amazon delayed the order twice and had me confirm twice that the delay was OK. December 12 they send me a notice saying they cannot ship the books and they apologize then note that their system malfunctioned and allowed me to order items for overseas shipment when I shouldn't have been able to. Well that's just great! The books were Christmas presents. I went to barnesandnoble.com instead. Ordering there was quick and easy and the books are on their way. I just wish Amazon would have told me sooner, now the books won't make it in time for Christmas. Grrr...."
"Ordered a lens hood for my Canon EF 50mm lens. Chose the standard delivery hoping it would arrive in 7 to 9 days. A confimation e-mail came stating it probably wouldn't arrive till January 3rd - January 18. The items probably on back order but amazon.com said it was  in stock. I'm cancelling my order and buying from somewhere else, I really can't wait that long...."
I ordered a sirius car kit for 79.99 well in advance for the christmas rush as a gift for my wife. I even was suckered into signing up for Amazon prime to get upgrades to 2 day free shipping! So I ordered and then I get an email stating that they the estimated shipping date is 11/27-11/28 with a delivery date of 11/29-11/30! WTF? What does 2 day shipping mean any more? So I deal with that since I do not need it until christmas anyway and I wait. Today 11/29 I get an email from amazon stating the item is not avaliable and will be shipped by 1/29/2007!! I quickly cancelled the order and ordered the item from sirius.com directly for cheaper! Amazon can be really shady sometimes!
"I wanted the hard-to-find DVD ""Santa Claus"" (cult classic from Mexico ca 1958) on 28 October 2006.  I followed Amazon's recommendation and added other items to my cart so that I could get free shipping.  The estimated shipping on the Santa Claus DVD was 2 to 4 weeks, and I didn't have a problem with that.  It's probably not a very popular item.A month went by and I noticed on 27 November they had broken the order into 2 shipments.  Both shipments were in the ""ship soon"" status.  I didn't like this development so I sent them an email that said, in effect, ""ship it all at once or don't ship any of it.""  12 hours later the 3 non-Santa items had started ""the shipping process"" and the Santa DVD was now scheduled to arrive ""after December 22nd"".On the morning of November 28 I had a resopnse to my email that did not address my specific concern.  I went to the page where you can request a ""Call Me"" phone call from Amazon's Customer Support.  Before clicking on it I went to my orders page and saw that the 3 non-Santa items were still ""shipping soon"" but the Santa DVD was not scheduled for delivery until AFTER 25 DECEMBER.This was unacceptable to me and needless to say I was upset so I went ahead and had someone from Amazon call me.  I spoke with John who was nice enough, even though I feel he lied to me.  He said he had a 90% success rate in getting items that had not actually been shipped yet stopped before they went on the truck.So today I have a tracking number and it is up to me now to make sure somebody is home to refuse delivery from USPS and then wait for Amazon to credit my card with a refund.  I think Amazon engages in deceptive business practices and fraud.  I relied on their statement that the items would ship in 2-4 weeks.  I relied on their recommendation to order extra things to get free shipping.  I relied on their email feedback system to head off a potential problem with the order.I have filed a complaint with both my state's department of consumer protection and the Federal Trade Commission.  I advise anyone thinking about ordering from them to be very careful when looking at Amazon's shipping and delivery estimates.  It's a proven fact that they lie about these dates."
"Amazon.Com once known as a pioneer in web commerce has fallen to a point of ridicule. By out-sourcing their so-called ""customer service"" they have effectively buried any notion of fair business practice. Their method is one off systematic excuse-making, false hope, and unfulfilled online promises. Amazon's guaranteeed delivery service is simply fraudulent. They will lie to you on the telephone in this aspect just to keep the customer service ratings high for their overseas call centers. Like Dell computer, this company will quickly learn the hard lesson of outsourcing customer service.I ordered a Canon G7 camera on November 22 and was offered 2-day GUARANTEED delivery (for recipet on Monday, Nov 27th). It is now Saturday, November 25th and the package is sill sitting idle at Amazon.Com. In the UPS system my package is specified as a GROUND delivery. A delivery which will not move over the long holiday weekend.Amazon.Com will tell you the package is in transit when it is not. In transit only means the company has transmitted the tracking number to UPS. It does not mean the package has beeen picked up, or is on the way. Large companies transmit the #'s in bulk, but the package can sit waiting at the origin for days until it is actually picked up.Amazon.Com had 3 days to resolve this issue and get the package to me. I called them each day to assess the situation. Each day they guaranteed the delivery, and each day they lied until finally I spoke to an honest customer service agent in the US who understood the issue and realized the error... 3 days too late. He said ther was nothing that could be done to resolve this issue other than a refund of my shipping fees.Ironically, I ordered another package on the same day as the above package, and that order is on time. Here the system does not discriminate, it screws you randomly which is the most troubling aspect of the grand scheme know as Amazon.ComWARNING: Do not buy anything from Amazon.com that is time critical. They will not honor their delivery guarantees!"
"Amazon ran one of the greatest shenanigan on the internet this Thursday November 23, 2006.The so called ""Amazon Customers Vote Homepage: Deals, are pure SCAM"
Xbox for $100  B-U-L-L-S-H-I-TIn the check out it was FULL PRICE 
"This is not a story of my last order with Amazon, ok well in a way it is. Why you ask?Simple. I now refuse to deal with Amazon.com because of a little fraud filled fiasco from earlier this morning.Everyone knows of the XBox360 for $100 deal I'm sure.Well today I was on their site just waiting to see if I was going to be one of the lucky 1000 people to get the system.  So I sat patiently refreshing every couple minutes just in case the deal went live early. Well I noticed something odd as of 10:58am.  The page now showed next weeks deals with no mention of the Xbox or any other prizes.  Hmm, what's going on here, right?Well so I keep F5ing it now every 15 or so seconds and as of 11:01am it's STILL showing me next weeks items with no mention of this weeks.Now I know I'm being picky here, but last night I made sure that I synced up my clock to the server on amazon so that my time would be exact. So at fully 1 minute past their posting time it's still not showing the deals.11:02am the whole site goes down for me and friends of mine who are wanting that sale too.  The site goes down so hard that you cant even navigate or ping via a cmd window to amazon.I contact amazon via phone and they tell me that their web guys did accidentally publish the site 2 minutes late and that at the same time their seattle linkage went down which means western washington customers could not navigate to the site properly.So I tell them promptly that I want that deal then since it was a fault on their site that caused me not to be able to order it.  She admitted that it was their fault but that they no longer have any units in stock.  So I tell her that they have plenty in stock for $299 on the site and I'm requesting a discount.  She said that these were ""special"" XBoxes. I told her bullcrap according to the site that they were the same XBoxes.  She then tells me that I am wrong, so now I asked her, ""So you are admitting over recorded lines that your site had a fault that caused customers to not be able to browse to that site and you bait and switched what item was being sold?""She told me to get bent, literally.  I then told her that I would post here as well as contacting the BBB.For proof of the 11:01 status of amazon look at my pic on http://www.hotwiredpc.com/screwedbyamazon.jpg.Also any moderators who read this, the site at the main directory is a placeholder for now so I'm not trying to generate traffic by posting that link so please don't remove it.Thank You."
Amazon cancelled my order with no explanaation.   They have also done this in the past.  Why take an order if you don't have the product and take all my credit card information !!!   IF they don't have a product on a certain date they typically move back the ship date and not just cncel the order.  I woudl think twice before dealing with them in the future.  There customer service is horrible and I will never deal with them again !!!
"Ordered an in-stock item.  Two days later the order was canceled.  Apparently Amazon likes to tell us they got stuff in stock, when they do not.  I will not do business with a retailer that LIES."
"Cancel order with notification, order was there then poof just drop out their system. No explanation given. Waste of time ordering from this shady online giant. They do not care about you."
Amazon cancelled my PS3 order with no notice or email and no compensation.  BS!
"I ordered the PS3 as soon as it become available at Amazon. It was being sold by Target through Amazon. I placed my order and got the auto-confirm. Today I check my status and my order dissappears without any notification or email on why it dissappeared. It's like I never ordered it. Very bad business that Amazon is doing, putting a product such as the PS3 up and having it available to customers when they don't even have it."
"They conveniently managed to lose my order between charging my credit card and transmitting the order to the third-party vendor.  I placed my order on the 9th, my credit card was charged, and I was told that my order was sent to the 3rd-party vendor.  But when I hadn't heard anything regarding shipment on the 14th, I called the vendor directly.  They had no knowledge of my order or any of my contact information, so somehow the transmission from Amazon to them never made it there.  Amazon's ""Customer Service"" department was of no help, telling me that my order was transmitted and that I should receive shipment between 11/13 and 11/20.  When I told them (repeatedly, so they'd listen) that the 3rd party vendor had not received the order, they told me that it was my responsibility to contact resolve the issue with them directly, and that Amazon had nothing they could do.  Since I can't get a refund back from Amazon until the 21st (the day after my expected receipt date), the 3rd party vendor suggested that I dispute the charge on my credit card and place my order through NewEgg, instead."
"I have ordered from Amazon many, many times both for myself and from work.  Generally my experiences have been very positive.  Decent prices, many products with free shipping and overall pleasing results.However, my last purchase has really turned me off.  I ordered a MSI motherboard on Oct 5th.  I received the order on Oct 9th.  The delivered product was not the model I had ordered.  I promptly resealed the package and initiated a return that same day.  On Oct 18th I received an email stating that Amazon had received the returned item.  After 16 days (November 3rd) and no credit to my card I emailed them.  They apologized and said they would look into it.  It is now 19 days since they RECEIVED the product back and the only thing I have to show for this is an updated status on my account that states Refund date: November 3rd; Status: Processing.Funny how it takes seconds to charge my card and take my money but weeks to credit it back. This is unacceptable.  I will be calling my credit card company tomorrow to dispute the charges if a credit is not issued by then.Sorry Amazon, you have my money, you have your product back and you have had 19 days AFTER receiving the product back to make things right.  In the meantime I am out ~$90 with nothing to show for it.  :(EDIT:  They finally credited my credit card today on 11/07 a full 20 days since the product was shipped and received back at Amazon.  I have yet to be notified of this credit and noticed only because I was checking my CC balance."
"I ordered a book from Amazon Sep 5, 2006 and sent them a check the following day. ""My Account"" stated that they were awaiting payment. I canceled the order and reordered using my credit card.My check was cashed by Amazon and cleared my bank Sep. 15.I had talked to Amazon's customer service three times and was told three different things.The first agent told me that my check would be returned uncashed. It was cashed.The second agent said I would be reimbursed within 10 days--I wasn't. If they were offering  me any credit, I was unaware of it. My last communication Sep 27 I was told that it would be 3 to 5 weeks to get my refund. That would put it as late as Nov. 1. That would be a month and a half after my check cleared my bank.I have purchased quite a bit at Amazon and it amazes me that they would be willing to alienate me and lose me as a customer by not refunding my $20.48, which is money they have, they're not waiting for my check to clear.  "
"""Free Super-saver shipping"" is ridiculously slow.  They still have not shipped an in-stock item after five days and project my delivery date estimate to be 16 days after my order.  I should have paid the two dollars extra and ordered at a competing site."
"Purchased Adobe Production Studio Premuim upgrade for $1175.43  Went to install the software and the serial number was invalid. Contacted Adobe Systems in CA, was advised the software serial number was invalid. Adobe unwilling to offer a new key number, employee Movis of Oregon office stated ""Amazon.com is not an authorized adobe reseller, we cannot offer support for this product""Contacted Amazon, spoke with Tabatha B. She instructed me to send the package back asap, get a tracking number and would process a rapid refund immediately upon notification of tracking number. Received an email from her to verify.  Went to Staples, submitted package, obtained tracking number. Contacted Amazon within 1 hour with tracking number. Was told by Jackie at Amazon, once package is received, refund would be processed. I disputed this by telling her that I had an email from Tabatha stating rapid refund once tracking number was received etc. Was told Tabatha ""had no authority to authorize rapid refund etc""  Called again, spoke with Jonathon, Team Leader at Amazon Cust Svc. Jonathon indicated he would process rapid refund immediately upon his supervisor finishing up a meeting. Was told by Jonathon ""I will absoultely process this immediately and email you to confirm""15 hours later, no email, no confirm.What is the real story here? Adobe and Amazon will not cooperate, both accuse each other of misleading me etc.I'm out $1200 bucks.Never again, will I buy Amazon products, also, try finding a phone number for them. I had to search the net to find a disgruntled individual who posted it. 206-266-2335."
"Purchased a memory card, never got e-mail and confirmation. Never recieved the item. But they didn't forget to charge my credit card! For some reason this part they never forget. Had to contact my bank to get my money back.The second purchase was sent to me by USPS (why?), and get lost. Will try to contact USPS in order to track the package. Pretty lame experience with Amazon. Never again will I use them.They harbor bunch of retalers and probably don't even know hwo is hwo. As soon as money are coming from them they don't care!"
"The customer service is bad.  They been kicking me around like a soccer ball between themself and eagle.  The order I place on 8/3/2006 still had not arrive.  When I call to cancel the order, they say they can't do that.  IT take 2 day for their shipping department (or what they call the responsible department to email me back.  No phone number is giving to me at all).  Their lack of customer services made me think twice from buying from them again.  As a great philosopher once said: Great Empire Rise, Great Empire will fall."
"Amazon.com really doesn't want their customers helping other customers to prevent bad experiences.  So they indiscriminately and inconsistently censor the customer reviews and ratings.    I ordered Haier HVB050ABH Designer Series Wine Cellar from Amazon.com. It arrived with visible damage to the factory carton and upon inspection, there were dents on the top rear, back panel and lower doorframe of the wine cooler.  This was clearly caused by the inadequate Haier factory packaging.  There was almost no protective Styrofoam or cardboard employed.  We decided to keep the damaged wine cooler anyway, since the cosmetic defects weren’t readily noticeable after I touched up the doorframe, and we put a large serving tray on the top.  Amazon had agreed on a partial refund that brought my net cost to approximately what I'd expect to pay for a nicked or dinged item at Home Depot.  So even though the Haier product packaging was grossly inadequate, we ended up satisfied with the overall deal that resulted from my negotiations with Amazon.com customer service.My issue with Amazon.com relates to their indiscriminate, and inconsistently exercised censorship of customer reviews and ratings.  I posted a very factual and positive review of my experience, including the inadequate packaging, the Amazon partial refund (a positive), the positive features of the product, and a recommendation that other consumers should buy the extended warranty.  My review never showed up on the Amazon.com website so I re-submitted it.  After several more days, I emailed and asked why it wasn't posted.To my absolute amazement, the response indicated that ""...your review of ""Haier HVB050ABH Designer Series Wine Cellar with 50-Bottle Capacity"" was removed because your comments in large part focused on your personal opinions of the subject matter, rather than reviewing this item.""!  After several email exchanges, including a revision I did to my review, which I absolutely didn't consider necessary but made in the spirit of things, my review was still not posted.Today I received a note from Amazon.com informing me that they have censored (edited) my review and posted it.  The author of the note proudly stated “I do not believe the changes I have made alter the quality of your review. However, if you would prefer to have your review removed rather than edited you may do so online.”.  Their edits removed any mention of the damaged product receipt, the inadequate packaging, the fact that Amazon.com agreed to give me a partial refund, and several other objective facts intended to help other customers.  That was the last straw.  Amazon.com is of course free to exercise censorship on their hosted forum, and in return, I am free to exercise my rights to communicate my experience elsewhere, and to not continue to be one of Amazon's premier customers.  I will no longer buy anything from Amazon.com.  "
"I have a lot of good luck with Amazon over the years, spent a lot of money there and even earned $25 through their credit card.  I've had only one really bad experience where they delayed a package for over 2 months and wouldn't let me cancel it because they were ""packing it"" and it took half a dozen emails and phone calls to get them to cancel it.Well, then I placed an order where the shipping was $5, and was charged $10.  I emailed Amazon.  Amazon told me to talk to the seller.  The seller told me to talk to Amazon.  I called Amazon again and pointed out it was their server that was mis-charging me and they blammed the seller, but later gave me a $5 credit.  That was nice of them.However, it was a credit that I later learned could only be used on Amazon sales, not partners.  Amazon usually doesn't sell the geek toys I buy.Well, finally I needed something from an Amazon store.  I was really looking forward to getting my new toys - astrophotgraphy stuff - and the skies had been uncharacteristically clear and I was wondering why I hadn't even received an email about my order shipping.  I looked into it and figured it out: Amazon is deliberately delaying my package because I used the free shipping I got for spending over $25.Instead of shipping it that same day or in a day or 2 like every other order they are delaying it out of spite. I ordered it Monday, it is now Friday and they still haven't shipped it and don't ship on the weekend so it will be at least next Monday before they stop sitting on it.Amazon is literally punishing me for taking advantage of their promotion.  They are teaching me a lesson, alright."
"Their customer service is horrible. I sent them 5 emails and I recieved the same reply back every time.  In my final email to them I stated that they probably did not actually read the emails they recieved and that if I did not recieve an actual reply back that I would never use their store again.  I was right because they replied back with the same email I had already recieve which is only a copy of what it says on the help page.  My original problem was that the website was sending me to an error page after i logged in to check out, so I couldn't buy from amazon again even if I could.  Save yourself some trouble and just go to the sellers individual site."
"If you order from a 3rd party via Amazon, you will have a great experience.  My overall experience on buying school books for my daughter has not been a good one.If you buy directly from Amazon, customer support is a barrage of screens down, if you find it.  They shipped a book from Dallas to Houston on the 20th of July and it is still not here.  They also split my order up and the shipping fees ended up to be 6-7 dollars more than originally quoted.M last contact with them they offered a refund on the shipping of the lost book and further advised to just wait.School starts soon for my daughter!"
"Months of communication just to get the item shipped only to be defective then they gave a $0 refund because they said it was a replacement - even if it had been they still should have issued a refund for the defect. Countless more emails to get the purchase refunded, which they finally did but just not worth it. looks like India may be handling customer service & there could be a major language problem now. Amazon used to be the best thing going for purchase security & problem corrections but now they can't keep up with size. Bettter to search out their suppliers, merchants or smaller sources and buy direct."
"My experience with Amazon.com was horrible.  I ordered a camera that was listed as available, but apparently the website was wrong.  I was not told that the camera wa was unavailable until I myself contacted Amazon to ask about delayed shipping.  I was led to believe that my order would still go through by customer service representativeson multiple occasions.  In the end, I was strung along 3 weeks  waiting for a product Amazondidn't have when I purchased it and apparently never had concrete plans to obtain from another source.  Amazon then had the audacity tojust cancel the order instead of attempting to solve the problem.  There were multiple Amazon vendors offering the camera at a higher price, but Amazon refused to work through them to resolve the situation.  The experience was horrible, and I don't plan to spend a dime at Amazon.com ever again."
"Amazon took three weeks to inform me that an items they advertized was not available, although their advertizement for the item never stated that they did not have the item. Their website makes it extremely difficult to contact them to complain as they do not have ""contact us"" links readily available.  Service on Amazon, including prompt shipment on ""special"" items, continues to deteriorate"
"No customer service, no refund on the order never shipped and never received. Nightmare to deal with, every time they find another excuse not to refund the order. Their toll free number 1-800-2017575, it looks like the call goes somewhere to India and from then on there is no chance to get anything rectified."
"Tuesday 18 JUL 06I placed an order in the morning for a new Garmin Nuvi 350 navigation system from amazon’s marketplace sellers. The seller I was purchasing it from was dupanunta@yahoo.com. I promptly received a confirmation notice for my purchase.In the afternoon I followed a link on the confirmation e-mail to check on the order’s status. The link took me to a webpage that stated the order had been canceled. There was no explanation on the page as to why, nor did I ever receive an e-mail about the cancellation.On my amazon account page the order wasn’t listed and so I had no way to leave negative feedback about the seller. I sent an e-mail to amazon customer service asking why my order was canceled, and a link that would allow me to leave feedback about the seller.Here is their response:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you for writing to us at Amazon.com.I'm sorry that you were unable to complete your purchase.

"Ordered from Amazon on 6/27. Order was to be shipped 6/29 from third party. As of 7/19 still no product. Amazon CS refuses to help unless I wait a month. Third party calls me a ""Jerk"" when I email him asking for a tracking number or delivery date. Third party is less than 100 miles from me. Called bank, disputed charge, will NEVER order anything from these morons again. Buyer Beware !!!!!!!!!"
"I ordered a computer, a electric guitar, and several toys for my children and a guitar book for my older son and when I tried to pay for my purchases they shut down my account! I attempted to reset my password many times but to no avail. Nothing worked. And so I rung up the customer ""service"" and waited for the next rep to call me and when I told them the problem they were a bunch of assholes and told me that I must've forgotten my password and hung up on me. These are a bunch of low life, idiots that should never have existed. BEWARE."
Never get my two rebates. The customer service is very impolite and helpless.
"I clicked on a link for a softcover version of a hardcover computer book, paid for 2 day shipping,  and was sent an old outdated version.The company would not work with me and I ended up having to send it back at my expense (they provided a return shipping label to download but the fine print says it is deducted from the refund because they claimed it was not their fault.)I see that the company Customer Service division already has a 4.27 rating so my experience appears to be the norm. I ended up buying the book I wanted from a different company."
Took over a month to get this gift certificate delivered and missed my friends bday by over 3 weeks.  horrible customer service responses based on canned assumptions and canned sorry...we want to help next time responses to multiple emails.  Not happy with amazon 
"Avoid these people when trying to purchase cell phone service.  I’m a long time Amazon buyer, so I thought I’d buy cell service through them.  Their customer service is useless. They openly lied and deigned I made calls every day when inquiring about my cell phone service. They hung up on me when on hold, then refused to take my calls after calling back. The cell phone “specialists” are somehow different from their cell phone “representatives”, so all my calls were ignored and my issues were not handled properly.  Now Cingular tells me Amazon has the right to charge an additional activiation fee and cancellation fee on top of what Cingular charges.  It’s BS.  Avoid them like the plague.  "
"Very poor level of customer service.I had a problem receiving an order from this company. I chose a one day shipping and the order was not delivered as promised. They constantly lied to me regarding the status of the order. I had tried to cancel the order on the second day but they would not let me cancel as the package was still in their warehouse. They claimed that they would charge your credit card as soon as they ship your order but in reality they would charge your credit card even though the package was still in their possesion. They could not give me a tracking number for my order until the third day of my order. Their corporate attitude is even worse than anything that I have experienced. I hope that anybody who orders from this company think twice before doing so. You will not get your money back easily from them. Also, you keep getting those stupid E-mails everytime you talk to them on the phone. They do not even bother responding to them."
"This was my SECOND ""hung"" order with Amazon.  It seems they have a system problem which was supposed to have been taken care of by their customer service department but obviously hasn't.  This problem causes orders to be ""hung"".  That means that Amazon gets the order but does not forward it to third party vendors for fulfillment.  The customer doesn't know and the third parties don't know and Amazon isn't checking.  After long delays, amazon's customer service reps force the customer to trouble shoot things with the third party vendors to make sure the problem isn't on their end before Amazon will check things on their end!  At that point, weeks have gone by and orders get cancelled and reordered from another vendor.  This has happened on two straight orders and they apparently don't give a crap about customer service/statisfaction.  The story is the same...""we're sorry and have turned the issue over to the tech department for immediate resolution"".  Well, after years and several thousand dollars of orders with Amazon...NO MORE.  You've failed your mission and I have no time to deal with a ""middle man"" that simply doesn't care or is too big to notice the problems they have.  To put the burden on the customer is ridiculous and to be so shoddy in business is a sure way to lose customers which amazon has done in this case.Amazon has deteriorated to the point of not being worth the headaches.  Just use their site to find vendors and prices and order direct instead.  Much easier and trouble free.  Oh, they'll tell you about having Amazon behind your back if products arrive damaged or don't arrive at all but isn't that exactly why I left them in the first place? Unbelievable.  Amazon...GET A CLUE!!"
"Amazon.com is screwing me out of 3000$.  I ordered an item from them on February 23... I returned the item (it was defective) within 30 days of delivery according to their return policy.  I am STILL WAITING FOR MY REFUND today on APRIL 24, 2006.  Over 30 days I have been waiting for 3000$.Every time I call their customer service I keep getting told its a glitch in their computer.  Nobody their is any help.Now I have to wait for amazon.com to fix their ""glitch"".  I have filed a dispute with my Credit Card company and await for their decision to do a chargeback.UNBELIEVEABLE.  NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM AMAZON IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE YOU MAY WANT A REFUND!"
"Ordered an item from Amazon and they stated it was shipped via UPS Ground (which is what I paid for). Well after some research on my end, I found out that it was shipped via USPS. Instead of a 3-5 day delievery, it now has a 10-15 day delievery date. I tried contacting Amazon and the only option is email. All 3 reponses from Amazon for this order were all foreigners with cut and paste answers."
"I have purchased books from Amazon in the past and recieved good service.  However, I recently made a purchase and have been extremely disappointed with the service.  I placed an order on April 8th, and elected the ""free shipping"" which was supposed to be 5-7 days.  About 10 days later, having not recived my books, I check the order online, and then discovered the shipping date was set for May 11th, more than a month after placing my order.  When I complained to customer service via email, I received a preprogramed response about the ""free shipping"" and ""shipping date"" listed in the fine print.  If you buy from Amazon, you had better count on paying the extra for priority shipping, otherwise they will use the ""free shipping"" as an excuse for putting your order at the bottom of the pile."
"I ordered 11 copies of a language CD and, based on this experience, I will avoid amazon.com at all costs.  Not only did I have to call them 3-4 times to find out why my order was delayed (it was all in-stock, waitng for stock, waiting to be shipped, etc., etc.), they lowered my order from 11 copies to 6 without my consent or notifying me.  Talk about a stupid, customer-UNFRIENDLY operation!!  I found what I wanted at another e-tailer and they delivered in 6 days, so I wrote amazon.com and their reply was worthless.  I gave up on them."
"""DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON.COM."" A-Z sellers SCHNEIDER_MEDIA and OTHER SELLERS is a ONLINE SCAM. This is one of the WORST experiences I have ever been through. and the first time and LAST time I will ever use AMAZON.COM! AMAZON.com is RIPOFF and a TOTAL COMPLETE JOKE. DO NOT TRUST the A-Z sellers they are SCAMMERS and BATE-SWITCHERS! I ordered an Anime DVD for $17.99 + 2.50 shipping from Schnieder_media, seemed ok his seller ratings was a 8 before i ordered. All the A-Z sellers can do this btw PROBLEM ONE: Shipping date anywhere between 21 March to 4 April 2006. BULLCRAP WTF is this about? PROBLEM TWO: Tried contacting seller, seller does not obligate to contact you back after he has taken your money. PROBLEM THREE Amazon.com basically has no costumer call service, there is a link to contact by phone but for some MYSTERIOUS reason it brings you too a dead link wishing they could hear from you... oh btw email us instead.. total BULLCRAP! Now Schneider_Media is all but disapeared and his ratings has have dropped to 50%. Alot of customers including me have been taken, we all have left bad ratings and now the guys online store with amazon has mysteriously been deleted AND you cant contact the seller through his email address which has been, MYSTERIOUSLY turned off. It seems this is not the only online seller that has done this. Look at Amazon ratings itself. ALL in ALL buy from CRAIGSLIST, EBAY, NEWEGG.COM. LETS GET RID OF AMAZON.COM for GOOD!"
"Bait and switch.  Listed one item for sale, then e-mailed back a week or two later saying they will not supply the originally offered product.  Instead substituting one of much lower value and performance."
"I am disgusted at amazon.com's handling of my order.I preordered an item from them in October 2005 for an item to release in December.  I received an email on December 10 stating:'Though we had expected to be able to send this item to you, we've since found that it is not available from any of our sources at thistime.  We realize this is disappointing news to hear, and we apologize for the inconvenience we have caused you.We have cancelled this item from your order'Unbelievable.  Now if I want to purchase this item, it will cost me double or triple the original price from other locations since it was a collector's item.  Preordering well before it's release should have protected me from price gouging stores once it becomes limited in supply.Thanks to amazon.com and their horrible service and their inability to honor a purchase order, I could not get the product for myself and for my friends and family as gifts.Amazon,com has lost another customer due to poor customer service with no attempt to fix the problem even after I contacted them about what had happened.  Not even a response..."
"Customers beware...Amazon.com gift certificates ""expire"" after two years.  Even if you ""redeem"" the certificate into your account, the funds vanish from your account and magically appear in Amazon executive's wallets two years after being issued.  They have no intention of giving you any notice that the funds are about to expire.Their ""customer service"" is about ten steps below insulting.  Email responses totaly ignore things you clearly spell out in your email.  Amazon ""customer service"" phone numbers can only be found on disgruntled customer's web-sites.Amazon has about $30 of a GC that I didn't know needed to be redeemed by a deadline and I have nothing..."
Why does shipping cost so much for everything and why does 2-day shipping mean two weeks or more for everything? I cannot understand why amazon.com sucks so much.
"1. Order placed on 12th Dec., supposed to br shipped on 22nd Dec. The estimated delivery date on 12th Dec. was 2-3 days.2. Order was lost in shipment. I have received no information about this fact.3. I experienced a lot of problems with refund. No refund on shipment costs."
Purchased a Motorola RAZR phone and sent in rebate.  Never received it.  Amazon uses an outside company to handle the rebate.  I contacted them several times with no resolution.  Everything requested on the rebate was sent in and was mailed on time.
"I ploace an order with 8 different items on it.  The next day I received an e-mail that four of the items were priced wrong and that they were removed form the order.  I could understand one or two but FOUR????   Then to make things worse, I go to look at the order and my ""Free Supersaver Shipping"" has now gone up to $21.00 WITHOUT any notice.  This was for the $13.00 worth of items reamining on the order.  This is not only bad customer service but I would have to guess that it is in some way illegal and definitely unethical.  I will never shop at Amazon again and I suggest that you don't either!!"
"This was frustrating. I ordered a Sharp Aquos TV from Amazon even though it was $300 higher than many other etailers. The reason for that is simple. Many, many of the other etailers has horrible ratings and abysmal comments. So, I carefully avoided them. Amazon sent me an email and said the TV would be arriving 12/16 to 12/22 (in time for XMAS). Well, I called the trucking company and they said all was well. (Oh, did I mention that the tracking number from amazon did not work). The trucking company call 12/23 to confirm delivery for 12/24. Now the problems begin. The trucking company (Valley Trucking)called on 12/24 and said the driver called in sick (They only have one driver for a whole company???). I called the trucking company and they said they cannot locate my TV at all and it appears to be lost. Well, forget pre-Xmas delivery. I emailed Amazon about this and they merely refered me to the trucking company. Well, SH**. I sent another email to Amazon reminding them that I bought it from them - NOT Valley Trucking. I left for a one week vacation on 12/26. On 1/3, I called the trucking company and they said it was still ""lost"". They said they would get me another one immediately. I told them no and cancelled the order. I emailed Amazon and asked for a refund to my credit card. It took them 5 days to respond to my email. But, they did refund my CC. Summary:1. Amazon home page says they will respond to emails within 24 hrs. - Actual time 2-5 days2. There is no way to telephone Amazon directly.(although you can call a number to request a call back. But, you really have to dig through their site to find it.)3. Any reference to tracking numbers on large items (20 lbs or more) are bogus and unusable.4. Support for items in transit is non-existent.Post-Mortem - I bought the exact same television with standard delivery (5-7 days) from  B&H; Photo (New York - Yipes! - 95% of New York Addresses are crooks). I received it 2 (yes two!) days later on my doorstep in California.AMAZON SUCKS - B&H; is wonderful!Arnold"
"I recieved 2 prepaid visa cards, each for $100. I purchased a $100 Amazon gift certificate with 1, and then purchased a $7 gift certificate with a seperate debit card to cover taxes. The item I wanted to purchase is a Zen Micro 6gb, which was 189.99 with free shipping. I went to checkout, and applied the $107 in gift cards, and the $100 prepaid visa. The order had a problem. Amazon charged the prepaid visa $1, and then rejected the card I could not order again, because there was only $99 on the prepaid visa, which coupled with the amazon gift card credits was not enough. I cancelled the order to avoid the automatic retry which I was afraid would keep charging $1.We called their (outsourced) tech support, which after much discussion, they concluded they needed the full 16 digit prepaid visa number, and when I refused, they ""transferred"" me to their banking department, which while ringing, hung up.=update=After a week of arguing with tech support, I finally got the order through a third party seller on their website, ""J&R;"". Amazon credited me $25 for all the hassle. In the end it all worked out, but because of this I wont be buying from Amazon ever again."
"YOU BETTER HOPE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM FREE TRANSACTION!!!I don't usually judge a retailer by their mistakes (there are always exceptions of course). I do judge them by how they deal with a mistake or problem.Let me tell you, from my experience Amazon.com doesn't give a rats ass about you once they get their money.I purchased Visual Studio 2005 pro edition.Received it very quickly. I go to install it and find I have 2 SQL server developer edition Certificate of authenticity and not one for Visual Studio 2005. And yes I tried both codes just for the heck of it and they don't work.I contact Amazon, their response... Here's an 800 number to call Microsoft. Great, I call that number, it's the wrong number, this is for hardware. In the meantime I replied to the email from amazon berating them for the poor service and explaining they've provided bad product and should have immediatly offered to replace it.Sooo... I track down the correct number, spend 1+hours on the phone, the Microsoft rep was not able to give me a COA that would work.I then get another reply from amazon's CSR's obviously based in India. They replied to the wrong email address, and then proceed to give me more Microsoft phone numbers to call.At this point I am pissed. Credit card charges are about to get reversed...I call Amazon and within a few minutes, their rep Amit is overnighting me a replacement and having me ship the bad software back at their cost.2-3 hours to get Amazon to do what they should have done from the get go.You dam well better hope you don't have any problems! If you do you now know what to expect. If you try the email route, expect to get absolutely uncaring, canned, cookie cutter replies from India.Pick up the phone and call them if you hope to get anywhere.I will no longer purchase anything except books. If you look at all the reviews here Amazon rates pretty badly. It seems as if books are the only thing amazon seems to handle fairly well."
"Kept delaying shipment claiming that it was being processed and I could not cancel.  In January, I received email saying that my order was canceled and would not be shipped.  Difficult to get questions answered--not honest.  They wipe out all links to previous customer service as soon as they cancel the order."
"I have had placed an order for Chamberlain garage door opener back in October 2005. Amazon was supposed to deliver by early November. Since, I only have received notes for delay, and yet again they delayed the delivery even further to back of January. There is no evidence that Amazon would ever have the item at hand, although it has been listed as in stock and delivery is estimated within two weeks. Simply, if they don't have it why they list? My suspicion is that since this item was originally ordered at a lower price, Amazon is intentionally delaying the delivery for those customers who had placed the order at a lower price to discourage them and have them cancel their order. Malicious tactic."
tried to order something but they deleted it for the 100th time. They suck! Fuck you Amazon!
"I have used Amazon many times before, mostly for books, and have been a very happy customer in general.  Their web site is fast, and they usually have been pretty pleasant to deal with.I wanted to buy a new TV for my mom this Christmas who lives in Fresno, and even though my local Fry's had the set I wanted on sale at the same price Amazon did, I didn't want to have to try and pack it into my SUV along with all the other presents and luggage for the trip to Fresno.  Plus, as an AMEX customer, I had a 25% off coupon that would work at Amazon.com that would help offset the shipping expense (the amex coupon maxes out at $150, and the shipping was around $130).  Though I had never ordered such stuff from amazon.com before, based on my past experience, I decided to go ahead an place an order.I ordered the Sony KDF-E42A10 from Amazon on the 18th, and the website indicated it shipped on the 20th, not via fedex by via Eagle Global Logistics.  Even though Amazon's web site showed the TV shipped on the 20th, the Eagle tracking site didn't show anything other than the fact they'd receieved it.  After 2 days of no activity, and seeing some reviews on Amazon about based experiences with Eagle, I started calling Eagle.  They aren't the easiest to deal with.  They said that even though there was no tracking info available, sometimes items are shipped in containers where the individual items aren't scanned.  I called the Dallas EGL site and they said it wasn't there, but could be on a truck to Sacaramento, or to LAX.  After several more days of no activity, and more calls to the various Eagle locations to check status, I finally reached someone who took responsibility and dug into everything.  he did dock checks at all the possible facilities, and couldn't find it.He found out that Amazon generates a tracking number and shipping manifest with them before the actual item shows up on their docks, so he couldn't even tell if it had ever been delivered to them by Amazon.  Apparently sometimes things get ""lost"" between Amazon and the shippers.  He said it was unlikely at this point the TV ever was shipped (this is on the 27th, 7 days after the order supposedly shipped).  After sending Amazon a note on this fiasco outlining the fact that we were only here a couple more days and that the whole point was to get the TV here when I could hook it up for her and that they needed to find out what was going on, Amazon responded that the shipper contacted them and said they lost the item, and that Amazon could either cancel the order or expedite a new TV.  I tried reaching them on their undocumented 800 number (sounded like it was in India), but all they did was send email to the shipping dept...  Amazon only seems to want to deal with email, and email through their web interface which is very painful and take a long time between responses.  Even though they first said they would expedite shipment of a replacement, now they say it's too big to be shipped by Fedex or UPS so they can't expedite it after all, and they will cancel the order.  This is despite the fact that fedex freight can do next day shipment.  Then there is the issue of the AMEX coupon I used.  If they are going to cancel it, then I want my coupon back.  I have yet to get a response from them on this.Bottom line, I am very disappointed with Amazon here.  It's made worse by the fact that noone there will just pick up the phone and call me (I included my cell phone in my notes), instead causing me to waste a lot of time checking email and trying to figure out what to do next.  It could have been handled so quickly.  I have concluded that if you want to buy things like books from Amazon, that works fine, but they aren't set up yet to do a good job on items like TV's and other things they can't ship the way they ship books.  Eagle is a terrible shipper, and Amazon's shipment process with them can allow mistakes to not get caught and drag on for days because noone knows where the item could be.  Stay away from Amazon for things like TV's and electronics.  I will update this when we get this finally resolved."
"Products were ordered on December 11.  Shortly afterward, my order status said they would be shipping soon.By 12/21, they still hadn't shipped so I sent an email and they responded that my order would arrive in time for Christmas.By 12/22 it still hadn't shipped so I called Amazon customer service and they assured me the order would ship.  I called again late in the evening on 12/22 and they assured me the order is going onto a truck as we spoke.On the morning of 12/23, the order still hadn't shipped and they said it wouldn't arrive and there was nothing they could do.You will not find their customer service phone number ANYWHERE on their site.  I was able to find the number elsewhere on the web.  Their customer service number is (800)-201-7575"
"I did get my items, 14 days after placing my order. The thing that makes me furious about Amazon these days is that they lie. They say that items typically ship within 24 hours, but that means NOTHING. It could ship in 24 hours, or, like my recent order, take 7 days for the shipment to be picked up. They blame UPS. I don't care who is to blame. They have just fallen off the earth in the customer service arena. There are way better online stores to buy from. Of course, no one has the selection of Amazon, but I will look seriously elsewhere before purchasing there again"
Purchased various items as gift for delivery to florida for retired mother and father. Ordered on 12/16-received email from amazon on 12/21 saying some of the items wont be there until 12/29.  Kind of late email and also said in email you cannot change or cancel order. Horrible service 
"It's so FRUSTRATING! Amazon.com stated on their website that they guarantee the orders will be received by December 23 if placed before December 16.  I ordered an ""In Stock"" item from them on Dec 15 and expect it will arrive before Christmas.  I constantly check on the status.  It was once said my order was ready to ship.  All of a sudden when I checked the status last night, it says it's not going to deliver until Dec 27. How disappointing!! I wrote to their customer service twice and they could not honor their guarantee. I really wonder what is the meaning of ""Guarantee"" to them."
"I ordered a CorningWare French White 12-Piece Gift Bake and Serve Set from Amazon.com.  It arrived with one of the two large casseroles broken.  The packaging was terrible, the box extremely flimsy, and it's amazing that more wasn't broken.  I also received a shipment from Target.com which came in the same box type (D4) as the above shipment.  (Amazon apparently handles the shipping for Target.com..box had the Amazon logo on it.)  It wasn't packed very well either.  The only thing that saved it was that it was much lighter.I followed Amazon's return procedures and they replaced the broken set with one that arrived in good condition using overnight shipping.  So I have to give them credit for trying to make a bad situation good.The last part of this story is the return.  On 01/08/06 I receive an E-mail which says in part,""We're writing in regards to Order 102-xxxxxxx..  We hope you're pleased with the replacement order completed on 17-Dec-2005.We have not yet received the return of the item(s) in your original shipment.  We wanted to remind you that you have only 10 more days from the date of this e-mail to return the item(s) we replaced.PLEASE NOTE: As we stated in our previous e-mail confirming your replacement order, if you do not return the item(s) in your original shipment, we will charge the credit card associated with the original order for the cost of the item(s).   Please contact us if you would like to pay for the items with a different credit card.  We'll see how it goes with them crediting my return.""The problem is that the defective merchandise was shipped back to Amazon.Com on 12/21/05 using the mailing label generated from THEIR Web Site and explicitly complying with their directions!  After I contacted Amazon.Com telling them I shipped the defective merchandise back, they said a note would be placed on my file.  I did finally get a confirmation E-mail stating, 'We wanted to let you know that we received your return from the above referenced order.  As we have issued a replacement order for this shipment, you will not be receiving a refund for this return. Rest assured that you will not be charged for the replacement item(s).""The good news is that Customer Service came through and things are straightened out.  The rebate associated with this was even received!  I did have to keep an eye on this process, but everything worked as it should.Unfortunately, I've had an episode where an acknowledged order was cancelled because of an Amazon.com pricing ""error"" on their part and no futher incentive was offered to me to make even a feeble attempt to retain me as a customer.  They seem to be going down hill and I don't think I'll be doing business there in the future."
I have purchase 2 items from Amazon is the past 3 months and both have taken over a week to even leave their warehouse. Both items were in stock and said they would ship in less than 24 hours. Amazon used to be one of my favorite online stores but their customer service has gone down the drain. Probably my last purchase ever from this store. 
Terrible shipping experience. Their Web site says item is in stock and ships in 24 hours but after you order it takes them 1 1/2 weeks to ship the product. They require their affiliate merchants to ship in 48 hours but they can't do it themselves. Yes I even tried overnite shipping for items in stock. It took them 2 weeks to ship. What's the point in shipping priority when they can't get it out of their warehouse. I diverted the rest of my Xmas shopping to other vendors since Amazon is unreliable. 
"I've purchased a phone using one day shipping method, and I got a confirmation email that says it will be shipped on Dec 1 and delivered by Dec 2. Today (Dec 2), I checked my accound, and my shipping date is reset to Dec 6 and delivery date to be 7. I contacted Amazon, and they said I changed my order which I didn't. They say they can't cancel the order because they are preparing for the order (what? for a week?). I paid for the expensive one day shipping cost, and they wouldn't ship until next week. They are just liars. There is no phone number I can call and talk with them. I would not use Amazon again. "
Ordered a printer for my wife for christmas. It was listed as in-stock 1-3 days for shipping with an est. del time of 11-30-05. recived e-mail latter stating that del would not be untill 12-29 thru 1-10-06.I e-mailed them about this and they sent me a form letter about there shipping policy's. Also item is still listed on their site with a 2 day del. of course at a higher price. very hard to find any contact info for them.
"On October 16th I placed an order for several items (a cutting board, facial cleanser, a computer program and a compact disc) using several gift certificates I received from a loyalty program. The certificates were 4 for $25 each -- $100 in total. I didn't bother checking up on the status of the order since I have ordered from Amazon in the past and never had a problem. I also received a CD from the Amazon Marketplace seller 3 days after I placed my order and I assumed the rest of the Amazon order would be along shortly. When I didn't receive anything I attempted to track my order and could not log into my account. I called Amazon’s toll free support number and received a very rude representative. She was chewing on gum while on the phone and I had to repeat myself several times as it was clear she was not giving me her full attention. The representative said the billing information did not match my credit card. That is a false statement -- it does. I never received an email or phone call from Amazon concerning the supposed problem my account and now my account has been deleted (unapologetically the representative said I had to start over and create a new one).Even doing so the certificates are no longer valid.I haven't shopped at Amazon’s site for a while and now I remember why. Their service is abysmal. Their failure to contact me regarding my order is unacceptable and the fact that they’ve left me in the position with $100 of my certificates invalidated will cause me to pursue further action from the California Attorney General's office if this situation is not rectified.The representative on the phone wanted to replace my order, but I explained to her the rebates for some of the items I previously tried to purchase expired already so there is no point in replacing the order. I expect to be contacted at your earliest convenience to rectify this situation."
"I have been ordering books from Amazon.com since 2001. All I can say about Amazon is terriblely late shipping and unreachable customer service. I ordered two books on 10-16-05, and I paid for standard shipping (3-5 days). It was suposed to arrived on 10-21-05, and it's not here yet. I couldn't get any infomation about where my package is on Amazon. And as usual,  I could not find out how to contact their customer service (if there is one) either. It has been five years, and it has never improved at all. I prefer to place my orders from the  bookstores in Amazon's marketplace, not from Amazon."
Buyers Beware!!!!!!!If anything goes wrong with your order there is absolutely no way to contact anyone at Amazon for help.  I have spent about 5 hours navigating their site trying to find an email address or 800 number to call for help.  They charged my credit card but my order has dropped off the face of the planet and there's nothing I can do but tell my credit card to stop payment.  This is Bulls@#t!!!  I will not do business with this company again
"I was surprised to learn that even such a established store could behave irresponsably to it's customers. I placed an order which was supposed to be in deal. It was a printer on labor day sale. they sent me confirmation email and said my order was in process. But after more than 48 hours back, they told me that they were not going to send me the printer because they could not sell  in such price. I don't know what to say after this. but all i have is a very bitter experience from an established store."
I ordered couple of books.  The store says the item will ship within 24 days.  But the order says the item will ship within 5-7 days.  This is ridiculous.  Amazon is penalizing customers for their free shipping program.  
"This is my first time ordering from Amazon.com and I already know I will never buy here again. I ordered the book ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" which qualified for free shipping. Its been about 2 weeks  and I still don't know when they are shipping it. Its past the estimated shipping date already. I'm hoping to get the book sometime in the next 2 weeks, I'm being very generous. If you want to buy electronics, go to newegg.com, cheap, stuff comes 1 day after you order at most and their customer service is the best. If you want books, order from Barnsandnoble.com, books came within a week everytime. I would not recommend this place.Ok, I just found out that my order will come in about 1-2 months. Who waits 2 months for a damn book. Their free shipping policy means you have to wait an extra 2 weeks for it to ship out. Oh yeah, they will tell you that you have to wait an extra month after you wait 2 weeks. Fuck amazon, I'm going to barnsandnoble.com to order my book. "
I purchased a Leatherman New Wave bundled with a Leatherman Micra for $49. There was a promotion to get $30 off if you signed up and paid for your order with an Amazon.com Visa. I did this as well. They refused to honor the $30 discount even though I have screenshots of the page that shows visible both products in the cart and the discount taken from the total order price. That screenshot is here: http://athensspringer.com/images/gallery/amazon_leatherman.jpgI am still working on this but they are not being very responsive.
"Up until recently I really liked Amazon.com. Prices weren't the cheapest, but they usually shipped when they said they would and they have very good return policy. I always used free shipping because if it said in item description that it usually ships in 24 hours then it actually was shipped within a day.Now some marketing genius at Amazon apparently has decided that Amazon should penalize customers choosing free shipping by pushing ship date 5 days further from the advertised 24 hours. The logic behind this is completely beyond me, unless Amazon wants to force everybody to sign up to that Amazon Prime shipping program, and this is really wrong way to do this.I recently ordered Canon Rebel XT kit ($900 with ""free"" shipping) that was advertised as being shipped within 24 hours, and it was shipped 6 days after the order was placed.I ordered Canon lens 2 days ago ($590 with ""free"" shipping) and was given ship date 7 days from the date of order. This item is also advertised as being shipped in 24 hours. I waited for two days, item hasn't been shipped. Yet if I add it to the shopping basket again and choose 1 day shipping then miraculously shipping date becomes next day! Switch to free shipping - and the shipping date is pushed forward 5-7 days. That is you don't find out that ""usually ships in 24 hours"" actually means ""usually ships in 24 hours ONLY IF YOU SELECT ONE DAY SHIPPING"" until the very last step of checkout process.Now, this is just wrong. No other store is so heavy handed in trying to make some money on shipping. I will most likely never ship at Amazon again until this policy is removed."
"I have used amazon for buying books and CD's and everything works fine. BUT if you order from marketplace sellers many of them are scamers. They post a digital camera or a plasma tv for ridiculously low prices, and then refund immediately and ask for money orders or wire transfers via wester union, typically to Romania. Amazon does absolutely NO monitoring of this to my knowledge, because they are up doing the same thing again, plus mostly have positive ratings on Amazon. DONT TRUST THE RATINGS ON THESE GUYS! IT is probably a small group of scammers who do many fake names and store fronts as this is not monitored by Amazon, one person can have 10 diff. seller names. Too much fraud, DONT BUY: Canon digital Rebel XT $500, S2 IS $300, Samsung Plasma TV $130-$350 (im not kidding). "
"What a joke! I ordered an item and have questions about their shipping policies, and can not get a hold of ANYONE for help. Their 'help/customer support' section of the site probably has 20MB of information, none of which answers any of my questions or provides me a phone number or email address. When replying to the confirmation mails of coarse all I get is the auto-response saying that I need to go online for help?!?!All I have is a simple question/concern after my estimated shipping arrival is longer than expected.Typical corporate type attitude: cheap prices with 0% concern for end customers. Next time I'll spend the extra few bucks and go with a vendor that appreciates my business!EDIT (08/24/05): so the parts are finaly in route for delivery (on time), but in 2 days I am still unable to contact ANYONE!! I'm happy that all will be here before the weekend, but I will probably not purchase from them again. "
"Amazon does not verify its third party vendors. Camera EOS 20d $800 is a scam by third party vendors. They will try other means to get you to pay, avoiding Amazon online pay. Reporting them only generates canned responses. During the past month I have ordered this camera from 6 different vendors with the same response. They say that they cannot receive money from Amazon and the want a Western Union money order. Decline and your order is cancelled. Report them and you get a canned reply and they are back online working the same scam with someone else. These scammers have a high rating"
I have had nothing but problems with Amazon during my (attempted) purchacing of this camera.  My orders have been canceled three times without my notification (was I supposed to guess?? or read thier minds perhaps) I have attempted to contact them to straigten things out numerous times and have only been met with genaric bulk responses. Tried having my parents use their cards for the purchace (under their own email address) and was met with the same response. I honestly have no idea what the problem is because they wont inform me. I really wanted to purchace this camera and have everything I can to facilitate them and they in tern have treated me (and my family!) like crap. I will NEVER do buisness with Amazon again. Period.
"Bought two books from them because I wanted to save some money. They said it qualified for free saver shipping. Sound's good, I like free and it said 3-5 days to ship. That sounded good at the time because I thought I would have it in 3 - 5 days. That meant they can take UP TO 5 days to actually ship it! Then, they ship it USPS which will take another 5 days at least! Every, and I mean EVERY other store on the internet that has free shipping menas they will have it to you in 3 to 5 days. They use deluded wording to get you roped in. I can tell you right now that I will never order a thing from Amazon.com AND I will never use A9 as a search engine. They also will not refund my money because it entered into shipping status which took another 2 days to actually ship! It's a farce."
i purchase an item that was supposely be delievered by july 18-22.  I received a notice on 19 that the item was out of stock.  This is ok but less than 3 days later amazon had it in stock.They could do nothing to reinstate the order.  They wouldn't even replace the order.  Amazon has gotten worst and worst as time gone by...
ordered digital camera through them was good price was an affiliate target comgot an email today said order was canceled was posted wrong price so as to policy they have this rightmy thought s are they should have caught it a week ago as i could have gotten a good deal on a camera else where ps was nt even through them there policy states they only have the right if its there merchandise was through target com go figure well they ended up giving us the run around  last time i buy anything from them
"Yet another so-called ""pricing error"" from amazon.  I've had over half my orders cancelled from amazon because they claim it's a pricing error.  How can one believe ANY price they see on amazon with all of the ""pricing errors""?"
I ordered a digital camera Samsung U-CA 5 from Amazon.com. They took my order and said to be delivered in Sep 2005. They cancel my order a week later. 
I ordered an item and they cancelled it without sending me an e-mail. That's unacceptable.
"Amazon does it once again...They offer an item at a low price, allow a bunch of people to place orders, and then, magically, decide to cancel all orders because 'the price shown was incorrect'. Well, then they need to shove it and fire a whole lot of people from their pricing department as I've seen this happen 8 different times during this year (2005).Amazon will no longer receive my money and I'll definitely start spreading the word concerning their tactics amongst my family and friends."
"First time I've had problem with Amazon. Selecting the ""free"" shipping option puts orders to the bottom of the heap, and they get to them ""when they can"", whatever the hell that means. Ship date keeps getting pushed out, currently Aug 3, with no hope yet of actually seeing my order. Phone support is utterly useless. Get the canned ""we'll send an email to the shipment center"" to process your order. Not processed yet, nobody will tell me when. Morons.*** UPDATE *** Bastards. They want me to edit my review since I finally got my memory stick. Jerks. It came late and took me countless phone calls to get the damn thing shipped. They sucked on this order.*** UPDATE 2 *** And another thing, why do they bother having that ""did you find it elsewhere for a lower price"" link? I reported a lower price, twice, and they did nothing about it. Jerks."
"Be careful on the reviews on Amazon website! They sent me an email and asked me to review the order. I did and, of course, described the dissatisfied experience with Amazon and gave 1 star for my ordering. Guess what happened? They said ""The service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. "" My suggestion is: do not trust the reviews on Amazon!"
"I have made an order of Linksys wireless adapter. The order was placed on June 28th and showed shipping estimates betwen July 15 and July 21. On July 20th (!) I received a cancellation e-mail stating that Amazon could not locate a sourse for this product (even though they are selling the same product from TigerDirect.com) and therefore cancelled my order. At the same time, they shipped the same item to my friend who ordered at the same date. They also hold up my gift certificate money on this order so I could not use it for 3 weeks. It is my view that Amazon simply did not want to honor the order due to low price of the item (it was lower that usual by about 20$). Waiting for three weeks to get a cancellation is ridiculous."
What happened to this outfit? They used to be good. I made the mistake of ordering something and picking free shipping. I ordered a camera lens. Shipping is scheduled to arrive 11 days later. Unacceptable. Meanwhile the camera I ordered came from another online store that also had free shipping and it arrived the next business day after I ordered it! Meanwhile I got this camera and I can't use it because I have to wait 8 more days for amazon to ship my lens. Way to go amazon. This is the last thing I buy from you... if it ever arrives.
"This is my second order with amazon.com.  The first time I placed an order my account got placed on hold because of billing problems.  I was never notified of these problems.  A week later I decided to call to see why I had not recieved my items ordered.  I was then informed that my account has been locked!!Everything was cleared up but I was never notified of a problem at the start. Recently I try to order some more products on amazon.com.  Once again my account was locked to billing problems...and once again I was not notified of these problems.  I order many things online from many companies and do not have any problems with their orders.  Amazon.com needs to notify customers if a problem has occurred.   If I didnt call them I would never know where my orders are and why they are being held up. I am not complaining about the customer service.  Their customer service is more then adequate.  Their business practices on the other hand are very substandard.  They dont even tell you if your order has a problem...even worse they lock out your account so you CAN NOT figure out what is wrong.  I am very annoyed by Amazon, after 10 years you think they would have an email telling you that somethign is wrong. This is the second time I bought something from amazon and this is the second time something went wrong. "
"I am customer of Amazon and I am not making the first shopping,I made several times from amazon.When I receýved my order I was surprised because at the center of the monitor of the notebook there was a died pixel which can be easily seen by a person who looks at it.it was not a used one but brand new.this inconveince condition changed my ideas about amazon.next time I will think twice while thinking shopping with amazon.alpay akyol"
"hi, I ordered the black special limited razr from cingular at amazon at 7/1.  on the website it said it will be shipped in 1-2 weeks.. today is the 7/21, I called in because I finally found an amazon phone number,  somehow a cs agent told me cingular is not allowing amazon to sell the razr YET, he said it will take until august to send it?!?!?!!? that means I will be wait for 6 weeks?! my local stores have the black razr 1-2 weeks ago.  I am kind of mad now, because somehow I checked the razr black page, and it said ships WITHIN 24 HOURS NOW.  WHAT THE HECK is going on???  WHEN will my order be shipped? I have been misled a lot of times.  I want solutions and I want answers.  I feel I have been cheated and I am too stupid so I keep coming back for more bad service and lies.------------------------------------------My movie dvds were ruined, I totally forgot about it.  Until I purchased from Amazon last week.  I e-mailed their cs, no one answered back!!!!!!!!!!!!!  "
"Amazon deliberately delays shipment of an item if the buyer chooses FREE Super Saver Shipping.Even though the item is in stock and is described as ""usually ships within 24 hours"", Amazon ships it a week after placing an order.This actually has happened for a second time and many others have experienced the same practice.  If you cannot stay competitive and actually offer a free shipping without punishing your customers choosing it, don’t do it.  "
"These piss ants sent me a pre-broken Plantronics headset in a very obviously pre-opened package.  The plug had been broken.  What monumental indifference to the customer!  Sending out broken, restocked items as new.  I saved $3, now I get to waste an hour or more reboxing it, driving to the post office and standing in line to send it back.  Save yourself from this aggravation.  Buy elsewhere!"
"I ordered a werner ladder for $129 on Jun 4 and the status said it will be shipped on Jun 13 - I selected the option of free shipping - free shipping takes a looonggg time to ship. And today, the 13th, I checked on the internet, it's not being shipped yet. Because I will be moving out this weekend, I called them to change the shipping address. Out of the blue, they said the order is cancelled due to price mistake. How could they do that? After about 10 days, no email from them, and I called them asking about the shipping, and my order got cancelled?? I really disappointed with Amazon. They can not honor their own deals. Shame on Amazon. Very dissapointed with their policy."
"I recently ordered 3 of the Grizzly H0611 Hose Reel w/ 50', 3/8"" Hose. They cancelled the order and said the price was incorrect. I was not happy but thought what could I do. I thought you had to honor an advertised price. Then last week I ordered the Leatherman New Wave w/ leather Sheath + Leatherman Micra for $26 w/ free shipping like tons of other people did. Amazon cancelled my order without even telling me. Now if I go to their site and list orders it does not even show up. They use their policy of not honoring incorrect pricing and canceling orders. The last 2 things I ordered there they cancelled the orders because of incorrect pricing. How is this not false advertising? This is obviously a pattern with them and they seem like they could care less. How is this not illegal? Someone needs to do something about this!"
"claimed it was a price mistake, refused to honor price on site.  will never deal with amazon.com again."
"Ordered a leatherman for fathers day, only to have it cancelled 2 days later due to a ""pricing error"". I was offered no compensation for the inconvenience. I have been an amazon customer for many years, and more recently and amazon prime member, yet they still screw me over. I am very dissapointed."
ordered some tools over he weekend and recieved a confimation email following placing order. Monday recieved an email stating that they had made a pricing error on the order and cancelled item. How can they do this? I thought that if I provided payment options and they confirmed order it became a contract that was valid and in place unless both parties agree to modify said contract. If i went to a brick and mortar store I would have paid the advertised price. What gives Amazon the power over all others to alter a binding agreement. This to me is poor business practice at best and criminal fraud at worst. If I offered my services and then doubled the price would customers return to me - no!!
"I ordered a little giant ladder that amazon had at a very good price...three days later the order was cancelled, but other items in the order were not cancelled yet coupons had been removed.  Very deceptive pricing practices."
"I have been a long time customer of Amazon.com and have been burned by them in the past.  The most recent was an order I placed for a ladder and some tools.  I placed the order and applied their online coupon to get a discount and free shipping.  A few days later I received an email that there had been a price mistake and they were cancelling my items.  When I went to check my order, I was shocked to discover that they had only cancelled a few of the items and had removed my coupon and my free shipping from the order.  I was so furious that I cancelled the rest of my order.  A price mistake I can understand, but what they are doing is criminal and should be investigated.  It seems that they are using low prices and coupons and free shipping to entice customers to place orders and then claim a price mistake on some items which kills the coupons and free shipping.  The end result is the customer orders items he wouldn't have ordered otherwise and Amazon gets a sale.  This can't be legal."
"I really doubt if I will ever trust Amazon again. It is very coincidental that so many people have the same issues on ""price mistakes"". I called yesterday only to find out the status of an order I placed earlier that wasn't showing on my account page.They couldn't find my order. My last order simply ""disappeared"" from my account. Fortunately I had a printed out a copy. It was only when they knew I had this that I found out my order was cancelled due to a ""price mistake"". The CS rep was kind enough to say I could reorder the item at the correct price and for my trouble & I coulds have free upgraded shipping. I said ""No thanks"". I'm done. What's ironic is Amazon says that it has so many million products they can't possibly verify all the prices on their web pages. Huh? However their shipping department is able catch pricing errors prior to shipping.So(if they wanted to )they can make our prices look really low to appear they have great prices. But because of their ""posted pricing error policy"" they don't have to sell the products at those prices. They can just make the transaction ""disappear"" at their convience. Nobody can do anything about it. It's their policy. Buyer beware!I would only recommend buying from Amazon as a last resort. "
"Got hosed on an order I placed. Will never do business with amazon again, was my first order, will be my last!"
"I have purchased many items from Amazon over the last 5 years and can honestly say that the quality of service is rapidly declining. Over the last 2 years, my purchases have been arriving without proper shipping packaging and waiting for a very long time for an item that is in-stock. One experience was when I had ordered a 6 pack star-bucks coffee, I was sent only 1 and charged the full price. I had to call and after many conversations before they 'prorated' the amount and charged me for that 1 pack sent and the shipping which was supposed to be free!!! With the last purchase(leatherman tool), my order was removed from my account and only about a day after which I received an email from them saying that it was a pricing mistake and therefore, they had no obligation to fulfil the order.I feel the quality and ethics of the company is rapidly declining and would hesitate to make any more purchases."
"Ordered a listed item from there website ""little giants ladder"".  Submitting my credit card information...received a confirmation email regarding my order...and then I received a letter telling me that it was cancelled.   The price was listed for hours and I don't think it is justified for them to simply list an item incorrectly on their website and then expect people to come back.  I think it's a way for them to draw more customers to their website as this is not the first time I heard of this happening.  "
"Like many others, I have been a long time customer of Amazon.  I have spent thousands of dollars with them over the years.During the past seven days or so, there has been a very suspicious activity going on with Amazon. Several items were put up for sale on the Amazon site (Leatherman tools, a Panasonic drill, a Little Giant ladder, and a Le Crueset pot) for sale at an outstanding price.  All of these products were listed as 'in stock' and permitted orders to be placed at the stated prices.Somehow, all the orders for all these products were cancelled without warning.  The stated reason was 'pricing mistake' in each case.  Oddly, those 'pricing mistakes' also resulted in the sale items being listed as Top Sellers in their respective categories.It could just be me, but this sure smells funny...make up your own mind, though.Personally, I will probably still do business with Amazon, but I strongly dislike their recent business practices.  I will certainly be thinking twice prior to jumping on the next great deal."
"Amazon cancelled my order for a ladder and leatherman tool set.  The price for the ladder was competive with the local Lowes, maybe $20 less.  Order was cancelled because they claimed a pricing error.  And then the 'free' leatherman item (buy two and save) was charged regular price without notification from Amazon.  Luckily I found the bogus order and cancelled it before it shipped, what a hassel.  If there really was a pricing error, not a poor marketing pricing desicion, the 'free' item should have been cancelled also.  I'm very disappointed with Amazon, not a class act by any means."
"Amazon used to be one of the best of the best when it came to online shopping. They have fallen drastically in recent months.The ""last straw"" for me was a recent order in which a hardware item was cancelled. I can appreciate a pricing mistake, and I understand there are errors sometimes. I don't have a problem with that. However, I was completely INSULTED to not have even received an apologetic phone call, a small gift, coupon, etc. as a token of apology. I've been an Amazon shopper since 1999! Never had a problem like this.To make it even worse, after I sent them a letter of complaint to express my dissatisfaction, Amazon customer service assured me other items (additional tools) in my order would be shipping soon. Guess what!? I can't find the order, I think they cancelled the entire thing! They not only insulted me as a customer, they lied to me.They've failed miserably in this situation, and handled this completely wrong. They ruined Father's Day.I mailing a letter to their corporate headquarters and will update if they help me."
"This Amazon is outrageous.  They were one of those places that I just ordered from, over and over again. Never needed to check Resellerratings.com.  This time, they cancelled my order - after it had moved to shipping mind you - negated the effect of a legitimate discount coupon and were still about to ship me the additional items at a ridiculous rate.  Outrageous, unscrupulous, almost theft.  I AM done with theses people.  Too many good venders doing a better job at keeping customers satisfied.  Amazon, if you ever read this, I DO expect you to do right by your customers regardless of any honor-less policies you gin up.  Bye!"
"Order was cancelled piecemeal. They eventually claimed pricing errors but deleted items in the order without notifying me of any problem. First a ladder was cancelled followed by some tools I ordered the following day. Hard to believe that there could have been so many different pricing mistakes. Curiously it happens on a Friday again, so that Monday part of the order is cancelled deleting coupons and adding in shipping charges on the remaining items. This is a scam in my opinion ,tje worst of bait and switch (actually bait and cancel)."
Canceled a valid order - said it was their mistake - but did nothing to attempt to remedy a valid order.
"Our family spends thousands of dollars at Amazon each year but it makes no difference to them.  If you have a problem with your order like I did today in not receiving it, DO NOT EXPECT ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE SATISFACTION.  You will only expend your energy making several frustrating calls and talking to people (one of whom I could not even understand) that contradict each other as to which carrier has the order and give a variety of excuses as to why the order is still on the way (even though it has been tracked as not delivered yet and sitting in the next town, 1 mile away, for the last 6 days...and as I told Amazon I called the carrier there and they do NOT have it).  My only resort now is to call the credit card company and have them reverse the charges.  While Amazon does have a good stock, BEWARE if you need customer service help.  You will NOT get it!"
"Amazon.com is perfect for you if you don't like to get what you want when you order it.  What usually takes one company 5 days from order to your door...amazon easily takes 10 days if it's ""in stock"" which it is usually not.  Recently my order was canceled 2x without my notice (found out 2 days afterwards...guess their emails are processed by the backassward system they use for shipping).  I will never buy anything from them again.  They make me sick."
amazon has cancelled my order and I'm very disappointed
"There have been a lot of postings about the Leatherman deal and I’m sure mine won’t be the last.  I’ve purchased around 50 items during the last 3 years (35 of these in the last year) from Amazon and it has been one of the three Internet retailers that I have used and trusted the most.  These are guys where when I see an item I want, I can place an order in about 30 seconds-I know the password and the screens, my CC# and street address are already there, I trust them so I don’t have to research them or worry about what is going to happen, etc.I ordered an item for the first time from the Home Shopping Network (HSN.com) around a month ago, got a confirmation e-mail from them with an arrival date, then 5 days later got an e-mail saying they didn’t have the item and canceling the order.  The first thought in my head was that Amazon would never do this to me.When the same thing happened with me on the Leatherman deal from Amazon, I was very, very disappointed and surprised.  It was the same disappointment I felt with the HSN deal (ordering something, being told it was in the system and receipt was eminent, then getting the e-mail saying it wasn’t going to happen-please shop with us again, etc), only worse because it was with a Company that I really trusted.  I know it is just a company and not some personal friend, but I did really trust them.  The surprise came from Amazon alienating someone like me that has become an increasingly frequent buyer and fairly embedded (I even got an Amazon credit card).About the price.  I didn’t know how much it should have cost, but I did know that it was a very good deal.  My most recent purchase was a drill where Amazon showed a list price of $170, that they were selling for $75.  I have seen many items where Amazon had a sale price of around 33% of the item’s list price.  Now looking at Costco.com I see a similar large Leatherman for $49.  Getting that one and another small micro for $26 from Amazon was a very, very good price, but not over the line of believability (like seeing a plasma TV for $300) and no more of a deal than some of the other examples.  I figured that they got a truckload and were selling them at cheap to keep people interested in Amazon or attract new customers.The e-mail from Amazon saying the price was a mistake, canceling the large Leatherman from my order, saying that this wasn’t a problem because their legal terms allowed it, and hoping I would continue to shop with them was insulting and pretty abrupt.  It also didn’t tell me that the “micro” Leatherman was still on the order at the regular price- I had to find that out on my own.  With either 1) a new proposed, acceptable price for the deal which I might have gone for, or some concession (store credit, free overnight shipping on the next item, etc.) this whole thing would not have left such a bad taste in my mouth.  I won’t say that I will never buy anything from them again, but they are definitely now in the pack with everyone else and not one of my very trusted internet retailers."
"Very poor company to do business with.  This is the second order in one month that I have placed that has been cancelled due to a price error.  They do not honor their prices, nor compensate for mistakes on their part.  Would not recommend doing business with Amazon.com!!!!"
"This is my order #. I didn't make a purchase because they cancelled the item and then notified that there had been a price mistake. I think this is a marketing ploy to gather customer info. In any case, it's a lousy practice."
"I am absolutely sick of Amazon.com (and other online retailer) thinking they are above what most of us consider to be standards of business - consumer relations.  I ordered an item from Amazon at a great price, not uncommon.  What was uncommon is that they cancelled my order due to a ""price mistake"".  THEIR MISTAKE - which should NOT affect me.  If a local store makes a price mistake, thay honor it.  What makes Amazon.com immune to this?"
"Amazon.com truly follows deceptive business practices (I guess they are trying to unseat the coveted position buy.com holds). Ordered the Panasonic drill/driver and reciprocating saw combo (Invoice: 104-1133696-7147160) and a set of Sawzall bi-metal blades (Invoice: 058-7963460-0554114) for $205.35. Well amazon.com conveniently discovered a ""PRICING"" error and cancelled the order for the Panasonic drill/reciprocating saw combo BUT hit me up for the sawzall blades. These guys are SO unethical that they will try to hit you up for spare change WHILE cancelling your primary order. When I called them up I got transferred to India where some overly apologetic fella offered me a $20 certificate for my troubles!! What does Jeff Bozo think ? ... really! Anyways, I will NEVER do any business with them EVER again and I cancelled their Visa card and I hope folks read this review before they order stuff from amazon.com. Just FYI, I had spent over five grand with them over the last four years -- and I got treated this shabby so take a moment to evaluate your chances. BTW, their customer service # is 800-201-7575."
"They claimed it was a price mistake, but don't take it out on your customers. Afterall, who made the mistake?"
"Beware! Amazon’s business practices include strategically placing specific items on “Sale” for specific occasions i.e. tools just before Father’s day. This is just a marketing ploy by Amazon to gather marketing information from potential customers.  After several days have passed and Amazon has gathered e-mail addresses, home addresses, telephone numbers and credit card information, they claim that there was a “Pricing Mistake” and cancel all of the orders. The value of the information gained by this shady business practice is enormous to Amazon. If they were to use legitimate means to gather the same quality and quantity of information, it would cost them an extraordinary amount of money.  This type of deceit by this online marketer should not be tolerated. Please do not order from this company and support their theft of personal information by fraudulent means."
Will never order from again!! Total scam!!  Cancelled part of order without notifying me.  Claimed product was a pricing error.  Customer service was very rude and refused to offer concessions.  Manager told me that Amazon did not want to establish customer-client relationships with people like me that prey on pricing errors anyway.  How was I supposed the price was an error?  BEWARE! BEWARE!  BEWARE!!   They do not want or feel they need your business!!
"I placed an order for two Items which brought my total order over $202.96.  There was a coupon for $25 off $199 whick brought my final total to $177.96.  The two Items cost $162.97 & $39.99 which they then canceled the $162.97 item as a ""Price Error"" leaving me with $39.99 item & withdrawing the $25 coupon.  I believe this was not a price error but a scam to not give the $25 coupon.  My faith in this reseller is now gone."
"I purchased a ladder on sale for $163 and because they were offering a $25 discount for orders over $200 I also ordered a Dremel kit for $75.  The ladder disappeared from my order as did the $25 discount, leaving only the full price Dremel kit to ship.  They claim the ladder was a price mistake but the way they handled the error (if it really was an error) is dishonest.  They should have contacted me to see if I wished to proceed with the full price Dremel purchase after removing the ""on sale"" ladder and $25 discount from the purchase order.  I'm very displeased."
"Amazon posted a leatherman new wave with sheath for 25.95, free shipping.  Ordered on Sat received confirmation on Sunday, today received notification that due to a pricing error, item will not be sent.  What a crock!!  I'm being punished for their mistake."
"First, they had a coupon that did not apply properly.  However, that was corrected by the CSR, so that was good of them.  However, then they cancelled two of the three items in my order, claiming ""pricing error"".  Funny how the CSR didn't notice the pricing error when I called about the coupon.  The cancelled items left one item in my order, and since it was no longer above $25, they want to charge a shipping fee for it."
"Order cancelled with no reason, no email, no explaination. The worst experience ever. They are not honest people. Just trying to lure people with fake ""lowest"" price, they also give out promotion code to encourage people to add filler, now after they cancell your order, they leave the useless filler in your account and ship the filller out.... What a scam."
"Amazon changes prices at will...Avoid them. Price ""errors"" seem to be a way of doing business. They are a decietful company"
"In my opinion, Amazon is a very deceitful company.  Nearly every one of my orders over the past year have been cancelled citing ""pricing errors"".  ""Customer service"" professionalism is virtually non-existent.  Do NOT patronize this poor company."
"Cancelled 1/2 of my order due to a ""price mistake"".  They didn't tell me they didn't cancel the other half and charge me 9.99 for shipping.Later, they cancelled the remaineder of my order...thanks Amazon..."
"This is not a matter of mispricing, this is shady business practices.Giving me one price, then trying to sell me a second 'free item' atfull price is called Bait And Switch. And last I checked, it wasillegal. I ordered a 'New Wave' with the micra as basically a 'freeitem'. Now Amazon decides they can't stand beside your prices like everyother company I have dealt with and try to charge me full price forhalf of my order? They also decided to take away the free shippingadvertised, and charge me the price of the item for shipping. So the price was wrong and free shipping was wrong too? Ido not find this acceptable at all. I will becanceling my order completely and never doing business with Amazon again. I find it totally absurd that They cannot stand by theirpricing."

"I ordered a leatherman, a little giant ladder, and a Panasonic 18 volt drill. All orders were cancelled due to price mistakes. There goes my father day presents."
"I ordered a leatherman and micra which Amazon had priced at 25.68. Amazon cancelled the order, saying it was a price mistake. If they post a price and allow a customer to order at that price, they should honor it.   I am not a happy customer, and have shopped at Amazon a lot over the years."
"I purchased a Leatherman 830039 New Wave with Leather Sheath for my nephew for his graduation present on the 3rd of June. On-line transaction went through without a hitch. Today, got this from them:  ""Greetings from Amazon.com.We regret to inform you that an error caused the ""Leatherman 830039 New Wave with Leather Sheath"" to be displayed at an incorrect price.In accordance with our posted policies on pricing, we are unable to offer this item for the incorrectly posted price. Therefore, we have cancelled your order for this item.""Nice one, Amazon.com. Instead of honoring their price mistake, they decided to stick it up to their patrons. Customer service is apparently not their top priority."
"There was a good deal on a Leatherman Wave Tool and I ordered it. It also had a buy both option, where I would get another smaller Leatherman Micra tool for free. Total was about $28.00. Amazon offered free ground shipping since the order exceeded $25.00 dollars. I placed the order. Amazon sent a confirmation email and an expected shipping date, which was several days away. Slow shipping has been another issue that bothers me A LOT with Amazon. Some times other orders have shown up in trickles over a span of 1-2 months after they where plced. With all the rebates, certificates Amazon has previously misbilled my order and it took considerable effort and wasted time to get them to correct their error.Back to the Leatherman. Yesterday Amazon sent an email cancelling the first tool of the bundle stating it was a pricing mistake. To make it worse, when I checked my order online they had removed the first tool, but left the second and now charged $9.99 for shipping plus $9.xx for the second tool, almost $20. I would not have known this had I not gone on-line and an looked at my account. It probably would have just shown up at my place.When I called the Customer Non Service dept and spoke to a Rep named Jessica she kept refering to the policy that it was a price mistake and they would not honor it. I got so disgusted with the canned response she kept delivering like a mantra that I cancelled my account, not that this bothered Jessica. Why do on-line merchant get away with this, where are our legislators? No major local merchant would have performed this poorly. I hope they go bankrupt.  "

"I ordered six leatherman waves for my upcoming wedding to give the groomsmen.  Amazon sent the email confirmation stating they would be shipped soon, but canceled the order stating that there was a price mistake.  They made no offer to give me a discount on the actual price, nor did they give me ANY sort of concession.  I will not use amazon again if I can help it."
"Ordered several items on morning of 6/4.  Received email confirmation of order shortly after.  Go to check status of order on evening of 6/6, but the order has disappeared with no explanation. Called to find out what's up - was told that since the items should have been priced higher, they cancelled my order, and if I still want the items, I could reorder them at newly inflated price.  Bait and switch???"
Amazon sucks!  They had the posted a promotion for a Leatherman and now they are backed out and cancelled the order.  WTF!  No wonder their stock sucks!  Why offer a promotion if they are not going to honor it!
"I ordered a gift for Fathers Day, the ordered was apparently cancelled because they made a price mistake. Most other legitimate companies honor mistakes they make, not Amazon, they cancel the order and dont tell you about it, no email, the order just disappears. I ordered another item to get the cost above a threshold for a coupon and free shipping, now I'm on the hook for that.Thanks Amazon."
"Amazon once again doesn't honor their price.  I ordered a Leatherman which was offered at a ""special"" price which was only revealed if I click to see the super secret price.So I clicked, I ordered, Amazon said they would honor their price.This appears to happen over and over with Amazon.  "
they cancelled a portion my order due to a pricing mistake without telling me...after they already accepted my credit card information...I ordered these items for fathers day and some birthdays comming up...I found out by accidnet they cancelled they never even contacted me...these people are a scam....they take the hits to the web sites and just fill some of the orders and cancel the rest.! beware before buying from them!
Ordered in stock item and chose 1-day shipping.  Item took almost 2 weeks to ship and even then they still charged me for the one day shipping.  When I finally received the item it was either a used item or was a return as it has clear indications of being slightly used and wasn't factory sealed.F- for amazon on this one.  This is the only time they let me down but it was a $500 lens and was unethical on their part.
I ordered this item for my dad for fathers day - they REMOVE one of my items WITHOUT EMAIL/PHONE CONFIRMATION AND REMOVE MY FREE SHIPPING.THIS IS A SCAM ORGANIZATION AT BEST FOLKS
"I bought a Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT camera on Amazon Marketplace. The sale was a fraud. I received a phony DHL tracking number and was directed to a site which looked like a DHL site, but which was a fraud also. DHL is investigating.I have been assured that Amazon.com will honor their policy and refund my money in a few days. However, Amazon continues to allow fraudulent listings on their site and to send misleading emails about them. Be ware of buying from Amazon Marketplace sellers. I placed six orders. Amazon cancelled 4 of them but refused to explain why. a 5th was a fraud against a highly rated amazon reseller who had to close her account to get away from the defrauder, and the 6th was a fraud against me which was described above. Amazon knows about these frauds but denies them until you are caught in one.p.s. Amazon did refund my money within two weeks."
"On April 7th I ordered an MH-53 charger for my Nikon 995 digital camera. I received an estimated delivery date of May 11, 2005 -  May 27, 2005. On May 21st I received another email stating my delivery had been delayed and that I should re-order by June 20th for a delivery in July. I don't believe they have an MH-53, ever have had an MH-53 or ever will have an MH-53. Based on my previous two experiences of this rogue outfit, I cancelled my order and shall be examining my credit card statement very closely. My other experiences were:The first was a book that I was billed for but which only arrived after 6 weeks and after I'd complained 3 times to Amazon and once to my credit card company. The second was a scruffy secondhand book that was misdescribed as a new book.I say avoid Amazon like the plague."
Very unhappy with this dealer . they cancelled my account for no reason and labeled me a fraud . I have been doing business with them for a few years now . NEVER AGAIN. They have no customer service . They are impossible to get in touch with if you have a problem. My advice would be to see what they advertise and then buy directly from one of their affiliates. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM AMAZON DIRECTLY AGAIN . nor will I recommend them to anyone . do yourself a favor . GO ELSEWHERE. They have finally cleared up my account but due to the extraordinary hassle dealing with them and the way they made me feel I will not deal with them again . My new golden rule for identifying etail shops worthy of my business is an EASY TO FIND phone number to call them and be able to get ahold of them on the weekends . Amazon failed miserably .  
"I will never order anything from this company again. They are bunch of liars. I ordered a 30 GB ipod for x-mass, paid overnight FedEx shipping and they guaranteed that I will receive my order in time before x-mass. WRONG, after receiving a confirmation e-mail that my item will ship out soon an estimated of 12/23/05 became 12/28/05 (of course they wont let you cancel your order because they are a bunch of greedy F@*!RS) STAY AWAY!!!!! Believe me I will spread the words about this company…."
"With good to great prices and free shipping on almost anything over $25, Amazon USED to be my first and last stop for books and lots of other stuff.Not any more.I live near one of their major warehouses, and even with free shipping, I could usually count on getting my stuff within 2-3 days of place an order. But ever since they started touting this ""Amazon Prime"" shipping scam on their front page, they've been deliberately sitting on my ""free shipping"" orders for as long as possible. Orders of items that are listed as ""usually ships in 24 hours"" now sit for days and days waiting to be fulfilled...the winner so far was an order of two such items that sat at their warehouse for NINE DAYS before leaving. It now regularly takes 10 days to two weeks to get the same orders that used to come in just a few days.I can only assume this is a scheme to try and drive their semi-regular customers like me into shelling out $80 for Prime, but to me it just seems like a good way of alienating Amazon's long-time shoppers. Guess what, Amazon? You may have been the only game in town back when I first started shopping there in '98, but not any more. And you can rest assured I'll be shopping at those other stores first."
"DO NOT PURCHASE CELL PHONES FROM AMAZON.COM! I've used amazon for books and CDs and they've been great, but their cell phone operation is A MESS! I've tried twice, had a terrible experience both times.  First in August 2004, tried to purchase MPX200 because of the huge rebate with AT&T; service.  They send me an email there's a problem with my credit check.  I call them, they need more info, fine 0 give them more info.  Another email in 2-3 days, still problems with credit check.  i call them (long wait and no direct number for cell phone dept. and their phone support # is hell to find), they tell me they don't know what the problem is (??) and I should AT&T.; I call AT&T;, they say there is no problem, the credit check went just fine.  Another call to amazon, more emails, my order is already 2 weeks delayed (althought the site says ships in 24 hours), lots of wasted time and nerves.  Finally they ship the order.  IT NEVER ARRIVES!!!  I check the tracking number, it never left their warehouse.  I call again, they say they cannot locate the package, but I should cancel the order and place another one (!!!), and they will give me $50 discount for the trouble.  I do that and the order finally arrives, 3 weeks later, although I should have received it 24 hours later.Now, that was the first time, and I should have learned my lesson, but no, their rebates are too good.  Now a month ago I want Treo 650, I see their price is the best, but I also want to switch my service from AT&T; to Cingular and have them migrate me.  Amazon says sure we can do it. I don't believe them, call Cingular and they say no, amazon cannot do it, you will end up with two accounts and contracts.  Call amazon again, yes, they are sure they can migrate.  I ask for proofs in writing, they send me several convoluted emails.  Ok, I decide to take the risk, place the order. SAME THING ALL OVER AGAIN! There's a problem with my credit check email. Need to call them. I call them, they dont' know what is the problem (!) again, need to call cingular. I call cingular - there was never a credit check ran on my account in theri system. Call amazon back - no straight answer.  The phone was supposed to ship in 24 hours, it has been already 5 days of frustration, I ask them to upgrade the shipping, they refuse, saying the time on the site is quoted from the time the order is completed, and my order is not yet complete.That was too much. I canceled the order, drove to a cingular store, and bought the phone, did the migration in 10 minutes and walked out with a perfectly working phone and migrated account.What have I learned today: Amazon should stick to selling books and CDs!"
"I looked for Sennheiser PXC250 Noise-Canceling Headphones. Resellerratings indicated that Amazon.com's price was $105, but when I clicked through the link to them, the price became $129.99 (still no tax or shipping). I have emailed Amazon to ask why they don't honor the price listed on sites such as Resellerratings. We'll see what they respond, if they do respond. I also emailed Resellerratings to ask where they get their prices they list, but the email was returned as ""no mailbox here by that name."" I've done a lot of buying from Amazon, but I'm beginning to wonder about them..."
"I purchased six oldies music cd's from Amazon. Turns out two of the discs were 'remakes' of the original hit songs with different personnel using the band's name to sell records. There was no mention on Amazon's website that these records were 'remakes.' This is fraud in my opinion. I have spent thousands of dollars with Amazon but I can damn sure spend it with some other vendor who choses to honestly represent their merchandise. Shame on you Jeff Bezos. Shame shame.UPDATETo Amazon's credit, their customer service credited me for the price of the discs after I complained to them. That solves my problem but does not keep it from happening to someone else. Amazon should CLEARLY STATE that an oldies album or disc is a 'remake' or 'remix' with different band members who did not play on the original hit."
"No promised rebate and no response on why no promised rebate -On November 21, 2004 I purchased from Amazon.com a Lexar 512MB compact flash memory card.  The price was discounted based on a $20 rebate from Amazon.com. I mailed in the rebate on December 1, 2004.  The rebate terms were for a purchase of the item ""between 11/18/04 and 11/27/04"" with the rebate requests ""postmarked by 12/27/04."" I've scanned all the materials involved, including the stamped enveloped used for mailing.  Not thinking about it, as is often the case with rebates, since they have a built in multi-week to multi-month delay, I only recently realized that I had never received the $20 promised by Amazon in the sale. I can't stress this fact enough. I never would have made this purchase if not for the Amazon.com promise of a $20 rebate. Without the rebate, the sale would not have been a ""sale."" Checking the scan of the filled rebate form I noticed an Amazon related web address to submit inquiries regarding rebates.  http://amazon.rebatestatus.com/contactus.aspxUsing this Amazon inquiry web form, a couple of weeks ago I twice requested information about may rebate (March 4 and 8, 2005).  I am yet to receive a response. Not a response of any kind.I included in the comments section of the form all pertinent information regarding the sale.  Note that this is a sale from Amazon.com and a rebate from Amazon.com and so the validity of the sale and rebate is easily determined directly by Amazon.com though I would be more than happy to provide the scans of the rebate materials.  But there hasn't even been the courtesy of a response from Amazon.com regarding the rebate.My options at this point seem slim.  I could spend thousands to sue Amazon.com for the $20 they promised to provide as a rebate. Class action suits, though unlikely, are apparently even less likely with a new class-action law. Do you think these are factors in Amazon.com's completely ignoring its promised rebate and request for information regarding said rebate promise?I strongly urge anyone considering a purchase from Amazon.com involving a rebate to consider the results I've gotten.  Perhaps I should have used some sort of return receipt mail, but that in itself adds to the cost and effort involved in having a company simply follow through on a promise it made. And, since I haven't received the courtesy of a response from Amazon.com, I have little reason to believe that it's the postal service that is somehow lax in this matter.--------------------------------------------------Update: March 17, 2005, 5:35 PM ESTWow!!!5 hours after I make this post (I didn't check the exact time it actually appeared) I get an email from the rebatestatus site.  So I'm back at the beginning of the process.  But I guess that's better than being at the end, stiffed.  ""Isn't that special?""Thanks ResellerRatings for the voice you provide."
"Terrible customer service and blatantly fraudulent advertising without owning up for it. Purchased two digital camera memory cards (Viking 256mb Compact Flash and Vking 256mb Secure Digital card) Each had two mail in rebates associated with it but both were asking for original UPC to be enclosed. Wrote Amazon about it and they asked to enclose copy of the UPC for one of them with a note explaining why. I did just that but a few days later, rebate center declined the rebate saying copies are not acceptable. Called Amazon and here is where I was totally pissed off. Customer Service (yeah, right!) apologized saying it was an error but there was nothing they could do about it. So I asked them 'So you advertize something and then back out saying it was an error. Whos gonna make good the money on the rebates ?' The reply I got was 'Sorry but mistakes do happen but theres nothing else we can do about it'. Terrible customer service, first asking you to enclose copy of UPC and then saying they were not responsible for it. Shame on you, Amazon."
"For several months, I was impressed with Amazon's care for their customers, including returns, rebate issues and prices, among others.  In particular, I used to be able to get help from Amazon with regard to rebate issues.All these have changed for the worse now.  Amazon has never been the best to ship orders in a timely fashion, and with most rebate offers having near cruel terms and conditions, it has now become a problem not to be overcome.  For rebates that have to be postmarked 10 or 15 days after orders, you can pretty much forget about getting your money back.  And Amazon is now shaking off any of their responsibilities of failing to ship the products on time for the offers.  This has degraded them to a dispicable low that can only be matched by eCost.Bottom line: be very careful with products with rebate offers."
"I'm reposting an old review so people can get the phone numbers for Amazon.com. Follow up to my review...I never did receive the EGC's they promised... Enjoy the numbers gadgetsuh.I'm amazed this place can stay in business...I ordered some stuff using a $75 gift card we recieved from family for Christmas. They deducted the initial difference from my credit card after using the $75 on the gift card. But later there was ""a problem"" with the gift card and they deducted another amount from my credit card. After shipping me someone else's merchandise and charging me more for the order, I struggled to find a phone number..this is the coveted number:   U.S. and Canada: 1-800-201-7575  International : 1-206-266-2992   They apologized and said they'd refund my card, instead I get a partial refund and an EGC (E-Gift Card)...so I contact them about this. They tell me they're sorry and keep the EGC and they'll give me the correct refund....again...a partial credit card refund and more EGC...so I call again...this guy says he'll cancel the EGC and credit my credit card.   HOW STINGY!!! After being told to keep the EGC as an apology, now they say they wanna cancel it?! Oh well...just give me my credit on my credit card...I get the run around over and over and finally get it straightened out. I hope you all benefit from the number above...it's hard to come by.   I finally got the right product and they finally fixed the charges on my card, but they have horrible customer service and are near impossible to contact."
"I ordered a DVD as a Christmas present. Ordered was placed 11/30/04 which I thought was satisfactory time due to holidays.  The website said it would be shipped between 12/8-12/22.  On 12/22 I still had not recieved it.  I emailed both customer service and the seller with no response from either. I looked desparaetly for a phone number or something in order to talk to a ""real"" person with no avail.  So I decided to wait a little longer. As of 1/3/05 I still had not recieved the ""Christmas present"" therefore I filed a claim to have my money returned then and only then did I finally hear from the seller and amazon.com!  Both apologizing for the inconvenience and saying my money would be returned.  But neither gave an explanation!  And still left me looking like a jerk with no ""Christmas present""!!  Finally recieved refund by 1/5/05!  I will definitely be leary of anything I order from them again."
"Very bad. I never had such a bad experience from online shopping.I placed an order for Lexar CF. It was displayed as 'Usually ships within 24h'. When I finished the order, the e-mail notified as 'ship on Dec 15'. I ordered on Dec 10th. When I double-checked the site, still it is advertised as 'ships 24h'!!At worse, it wasn't shipped until Dec 17th. Although Amazon told me the tracking #, it was incorrect.I had several e-mail communication with customer support. But the support is very bad. They don't see my previous e-mail and always say 'you can track your package with provided tracking #'. But my tracking # is incorrect and they say they don't have correct one.Finally, I requested refund because it was not delivered even Dec 27th. Today is Dec 30th but no deliver. I don't think they sent it to me.I never buy from Amazon."
"I ordered from Amazon/Discovery Channel Store my order was canceled without any notification I called Amazon CS and was blown off, I left negative feed back for Discovery Channel Store on Amazon's site and Amazon promptly removed my(and many others) negative feedback. For my inconvenience Discovery Channel Store said that they would mail me a $5 gift card, I expect it to arrive at the same time as the rest of my canceled order.Tom"
"Not a good experience at all. Ordered a book online through Borders Books. Book was listed as not yet released and would be shipped in late December. Found book same day in a local bookstore and purchased it. Went to cancel online order and found they had placed it in the 'shipping process queue' and was unable to be cancelled. How they can be shipping something they list as not even published yet is beyond me, even though the book had beeen out for a week or so. An email to Customer Service didn't get answered for 3 business days and stated that once something is listed as entering the shipping process, there is nothing that can be done. No 800 telephone contact ability."
Amazon supports dishonest sellers like Usedbooks123. Usedbooks123 will send out cancelled orders for the sole purpose of filing a claim. This is dishonest and I will no longer deal with Amazon.
"Amazon.com service just sucks.I ordered two mobile phones with TMobile servcie from amazon.com. TMobile says they have sent the credit approval and Amazon says they didnot receive it. Moreover Amazon said they can get the approval ""manually"" if I can provide my credit info to the - and they said this three times and have taken my credit info threee times. Today is 14th day after I placed my order and amazon says I didnot give my credit verification info to them at all.Is anybody at amazon listening ? It's shame on you."
"I originally ordered the Ryobi trimmer on the above listed date. The delivery date was to be July 6th, 2004. The item never came to my residence. I called and complained about the item and another date was set and the item never came. I complained again and received on line a coupn toreduce the shipping costs for my inconveince. I thought for sure this time I would get the product it never came. Get what Amazon you won summer was now over and I gave up, but I am still very annoyed. That was a gift that my father never received. At this point I would never purchase anything or recommend Amazon.com to anyone. When I receive an e-mail I automatically delete it.  "
"I am amazed that Amazon would let a seller like this be a representative of their services!!  This was my first purchase, a dvd collectors set(which are pricey) listed as a new/sealed item.  With the way the site is set up to purchase items, I had no idea I was purchasing this item from a third party nor from a store other than Amazon, nor was I made aware of how to review this third party seller's reputation.  This item has has not yet arrived.  Upon investigating the missing item I found the seller's feed back rating, 68% NEGATIVE.  Upon further investigation I found this seller has no current listings for sale.  I have emailed the seller and Amazon.  I have heard from neither.  Amazon's buyer protection policies seem to be conflicting.  We will see how this plays out."
"I shopped online at 7 different sites and the only one that provided unacceptable service was Amazon.com.    On December 2, I visited their site and found 5 books that I wanted and all were stated to be in stock and available for free shipping and would arrive in a single shipment.   When I went to checkout, I received a notice that, if I wanted these items before Christmas, I would have to pay an additional $7.95 shipping charge (this is over three weeks before Christmas).   I agreed to the additional shipping charge and placed my order.    I received three of the items and upon visiting their site (they didn’t bother to inform me by E-mail), I have determined that the remaining two items will not arrive in time for Christmas.   In the future, I will shop at other sites.   Buy.com is excellent and has much of the same merchandise as Amazon.com.      "
"Amazon is becoming more and more disappointing in delivering items and customer service.  My order for a compact flash card was placed on 11/19.  I bought this particular flash card because of a rebate offering.  Initially, there was no indication that the item was not in stock.  However, when I received the confirmation e-mail, it stated that the item would not be shipped until the end of January!  This is almost 2 1/2 months!  Furthermore, the ship date extended past the rebate window.  I contacted Amazon about the rebate window, and after two e-mail exchanges had them tell me that they would honor the rebate themselves as long as I sent in a ""hand-written note"" explaining the situation.  Huh?So, I contacted the manufacturer of the flash card directly and asked why Amazon had a 2 1/2 month backorder on their cards.  To my surprise, the company responded by saying that Amazon was now in an ""in-stock position"" and would be able to ship within the window.  However, 3 weeks later Amazon has not changed my order status or estimated ship date, and my two inquiries about their stock levels has received no response.Amazon has definitely lost the integrity and responsiveness they once held in my opinion.  They rarely even have a competitive price anymore.  I don't see much reason to shop with Amazon in the future. "
"I like Amazon's selections and price but I hate Amazon's service!!Customer service is non-existent.you can't never speak to real person for any matter, you have to rely on internet links to communicate with customer service and they reply via email on their pace.  Respond time is what makes me laugh.If I get lucky, I get a respond in 24 hours, sometime I don't get any respond at all!!! I ordered canon 420ex flash for my digital camera on December 1. I went with free shipping (my biggest mistake of my life time!!) because it's estimate delivery day was Dec 9 ~ Decemeber 11 and  I had a big family gathering on December 13 that I want to capture good picture with this flash light.I have been checking my shipping status daily and found out that on Dec 9, my order status was still listed as ""Billing Information Received."" and I began to panic and wrote a inquriy (of course, by  using link). On Dec 10, Gaurav Bhalla, a Amazon Customer Service wrote me back saying ""I can assure you that the package is on its way and should arrive by December 9 - December 11, 2004."" I did  not receive my item on Dec 11, 2004.  I wrote two more inquiries but did not get any respond back.Today is December 14 and my item is still not deliver.  According to UPS tracking system, I should get it today. If you need to order by specific date, please don't rely on Amazon."
I hate Amazon I ordered Buffy The Vampire Slayer season 7 and Smallville Season 3 on November 10th 2004. They came out November 16 2004 my item didn't ship until November 19th then my address was right but I never got it so on December 1st they gave me my money back but charged me four bucks. I know it isn't alot but it's the principles about it.
"amazon cancelled my order because they had ""the wrong price on the item"" unless they fix this and honor the purchase price, they will have lost a customer of many years."
"I ordered 2 items from here, a game that was not released till 2 weeks from today and a music CD that they had in-stock. The music CD came in about 2 months later, and the game, I'm still waiting on. On their site it says ""usually ships within 24 hours"" I assume that means they have the item in-stock. I checked my account, and it says that order is still in process. I emailed them serveral times about this issue, and has only gotten a response 2 weeks later. They changed my status to ""shipping soon"" and it's been like that for 3 days now. They still haven't shipped the item. I think they did that because of my emails. They probably hope to calm me down, but they just anger me more. I had never saw a status like that before, and I ordered from them many times before. They did not even compensate me for this aggravation. I'm glad they didn't, because I wouldn't want to shop there ever again, even if they gave me $1,000 credit to shop there. They have a slow service and horrible shipping time. I used to use them years ago, but now they have gone downhill. I would not recommend anyone to use this company. I rather use buy.com, or some small local internet company than amazon.com. They lost one old faithful customer.A warning to all, do not use this service unless you don't care how long it takes to ship to you and you want to pay more. Other sites have cheaper prices then this company and they have better service.Update: They finally ""sent"" out my package after 4 days. They gave me a tracking number,  but when I check the tracking, the site gives the error ""We're sorry. We're temporarily unable to display all your orders below. Rest assured, we're working on the problem and expect to resolve it shortly. If you don't see the order you're looking for, please wait a few minutes, then visit this page again."" Isn't it a coincidence that I can't check my status, when they claim that they sent out my package? Amazon is really really enraging me. If this review was uncensored, I would use all 5000 characters to curse at them! Amazon is horrible!"
horrible shippingPlaced order on nov 26th and it still hasnt shipped.  products listed as in stock and is currently still in stock.  estimated delivery time is 23rd of DEC? what kind of crap is that? i gotta wait almost 30 days just cause i chose free shipping? even with previous orders where I paid for shipping shipped late. bottom line is its not worth the wait just to save a few cents at amazon.
"Pre-ordered the Seinfeld Gift Set on 13 August 2004. The gift set was released 23 November. Do I receive it 23 November? No. Does Amazon ship it 23 November? No. They don't even ship it until 27 November (hopefully). Amazon is the slowest processing slowest shipper I've ever been to on the web and I will NEVER order through them again. It's inconceivable that a pre-order wouldn't be shipped until days after the item is released. Amazon, what's the point of pre-ordering if this is the kind of service I'm going to get? "
"Horrible buying experience, horrible companyI placed my order for a Sansik 512MB cruzer micro on october 28th and their shipping estimate for the product was december 4th thtough the 21st!Completely unacceptableWhat makes this worse is that theres a rebate on the item specifically for amazon that has a postmark deadline.  If my shipment isnt till late december I cant make that deadline and amazon has basically cheated me out of a rebateIf that wasnt enough, amazon conceals their customer service phone number so no one can find it on their pageI guess they dont want people complaining to them about their bad serviceThat number is:1-800-201-7575Feel free to call and raise hell"
"I was charge twice for 1 dvd, when i called customer service they told me i had ordered 2 dvds which i hadn't, they say they will look into this but i suspected in the end the second charge will remain."
"Extremely Dissatisfied with Amazon, slow delivery, bad service, no customer service phone number to rectify the order, unclear policy about promotional certification, too many type of promotional certification to confuse customer.Do not allow multiple promotional certificate, yet ask customers to enter as many certificate as possible.  It end up customer confused as to how many certificate can be used.Customer service just gave empty promise, told me Account Department will take care of promotional certificate, but no news after few days.totally unacceptable for big internet company."
"Placed an order on October 2nd, got wrong item. NO customer service phone number on their site. With Google help I found it. Talked to their rep and promised that correct item will be shipped this time. Good - free shipping back to Amazon, bad - wrong item AGAIN. Called customer service again (as I was advised by first customer service rep) this time could no understand a WORD what customer service rep was saying. Even though my native language is not English either, but I would NOT hire someone as customer service rep that does not speak well and is rude. 	When I asked to speak to supervisor been told he is in the meeting? Amazon's only supervisor in the meeting?  So I'm sending it back, again. Amazon is only good when nothing goes wrong... If there's something wrong - customer service is horrible and it's impossible to find their phone numberBtw here's their number: 1-800-201-7575 (just in case)"
"**I'm unhappy and staying away from Amazon for future purchases**You can find the exact same products cheaper elsewhere, with better customer support, and shipped free in the same amount of time...I only chose to make my purchase through them so that I may try their services and seeing that my purchase price with shipping was nearly identical to other merchants prices....They won't pricematch.....They don't provide a phone number for customer support, and it takes two to three business days to get a reply through emails... However, their free shipping did take less time than their estimate..."
"Of the many purchases I have made online in the past five years or so this has been the worst.  My order was a book and cd, both items were in stock and labelled as ""ready to ship in 24 hours.""  My order was over $25, so Amazon offered free shipping.  Their shipping is the worst of any site I have ever ordered from.  If you take the free shipping, they will hold your order for almost a week, then ship it.  My order could have been ready that next day and shipped in a few days, but Amazon's business practices say to hold it for more than a week, then ship it.  I know they listed in their order page that they could do this, but I could never imagine a corporation taking advantage of the customer like this.When possible, Amazon.com will never receive my business again."
"I bought a Digital Rebel on June 1st. It came with a bad battery, would say ""change battery pack"" even at a full charge. I bought another for about $55. The photoshop elements cd it came with also will not be read in any pc cdrom drive. This is a $80+ value. I called customer service, they decided that since I didn't want to have to ship it back that they would let me have the $50 promo that started the very next day after I had bought it and was still going. This was just last week. They said to check my email for a code. Well it's been over a week so I emailed Amazon. They now claim they won't give me it. It seems they rather have me return a $937 purchase instead of help me out with my losses."
"Amazon.com is fine - fast shipping, etc. UNLESS you have a gripe to pick with them.  I ordered a Hoover Steamvac from them on June 30th in the late evening - the order had been confirmed by the next day, when there was a new $25 discount available from the same department.  There is NO CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUMBER on Amazon's site - what the heck kind of service is that?  I kept writing emails to them to ask if they could possibly apply the $25 coupon for me, since I had literally ordered it hours before the promotion started, and because the item was big and heavy and it woudln't be cost effective to ship it back and reorder.  Twice, I got back emails from Indian reps telling me I must have gotten my dates confused - even though I kept writing that I DID know that the promotion started the day after I ordered - however, had I bought the vacuum from a B&M; store, I would have been able to take the receipt ONLY to the store and get an automatic price adjustment.  Finally, on my third email, I demanded a customer service phone number, and never got a reply.Fortunately for Amazon, they still have good enough prices wiht their free shipping that I will still occasionally order from them - however, next time I buy an item like household goods, I will just save up my BBB or LNT coupons and just buy them in-store to save myself the trouble.Customer service should NOT be outsourced - I don't know why companies are putting so little focus on the customer, and instead just on cheap labor."
"Returned item to Amazon Merchant (Tiger Direct) per Amazon return policy.  On June 21, 2004 the merchant notified and issued a credit to Amazon equal to the original cost of the item, consitent with Amazon refund procedure a stated on their site.I have not received the redund and now must wait for an Amazon A-Z process to unfold, whick cold take another two weeks, per an email from Amazon.No phone numbers are available for Amazon, so resolving issues will almost certainly take days at least.The customer support process that Amazon has in place, based on this experience, clearly serves their needs far more than the customers needs.While I am fairly confident that a refund will be processed, waitings weeks after the Amazon Merchant fullfilled their obligation is unacceptable.UPDATE:  After finding an 800 number for CS in one of the reviews on this site, I called Amazon and a refund has been issued.  Posting a phone number on the website would have likely prevented my struggles and the negative remarks.  I will still not purchase with an Amazon Merchant in the fuutre."
"I placed this order on amazon on June 04. It arrived on June 09. Then I decided to return it. The item was purchased using Borders gift card. According to their rules, they were supposed to issue refund as amazon gift certificate that should have been emailed to me. Here is when my problems started. I have shipped the product back on June 15 and, according to the USPS tracking information, they received it on June 18 or 19. On June 24 I called and inquired about my refund. I was told that refund usually takes 7-10 business days, so I prepared to wait. I called later on June 29 and was given the same answer. I sent them an email stating that I am not happy with their processing timelines. I was given an automated answer that their customer serviced is working on it. Later, I had another email where a c.s. rep apologized for inconvinience and re-stated their return policy in a very dry way. I called on July 1st and was told by Justin (another cs. rep) that the refund should definitely be mailed to me by the end of the business day. Of course nothing came in and when I called on July 5th I was again explained their business policy. I was disappointed and told them that. They pretty much ignored my comments while keeping re-stating their policies. It is July 7th and I still have no refund. How much more should I wait?"
"Twice now I have had to initiate a request for a refund.  It's been over over 3 weeks since I was told I would receive a refund from their A-Z guarantee program.  Recently, I made another purchase for some DVDs, and was told I would receive a refund because the package didn't make it to its destination. This notice, dated 6/21/04 stated, ""If by July 26, 2004 (4 weeks after the estimated delivery date) you have still not received notification of a refund, please let us know by visiting...""  I cannot understand why it takes so long for these refunds!  Update on 6/27/04:  Well, after my complaint to amazon, I recieved the following: ""I have checked your account and note that Guarantee claim could not be submitted successfully on June 04, 2004.  I apologize for the inconvenience.I have again submitted an A-to-z Guarantee claim on your behalf for ""Canon EOS 6.3MP Digital Rebel Camera with Lens 18-55MM Lens"" (#058-5272546-9017961).    Guarantee claims generally take from 2-3 weeks to process; you'll receive an e-mail notification when it is complete.""  So, my advice to others, if you paid by credit card, go through our credit card company to cancel the order.  Don't wait for Amazon to take care of it!  This really seems like a scam, to hold your money for as long as possible."
"WARNING: NEVER BUY THROUGH AMAZON.COM'S MERCHANTS.By Merchants, I mean when Amazon.com sells items that are then forwarded to companies such as J&R; and Circuit City. My experiences through Amazon merchant Circuit City has been a complete and utter nightmare.For starters, Amazon.com Payments IMMEDIATEDLY charges the amount of the order to your credit card and credits that same amount to the merchant. This is the poorest business practice I've ever dealt with. Furthermore, you cannot cancel orders online. Once the order goes through, you then must deal with the merchant with any issues you might have. For the record, Circuit City has the worst customer service I've ever had to deal with. After nearly 30 days, they still have not processed my refund for the cancelled order.Lastly, Amazon.com believes in impersonal customer support via web form emails. After searching their entire website for anything that resembled a customer service hotline, I came up empty-handed. I finally searched google for the hotline and found it: 1-800-201-7575. They seem to have 24 hr customer support, so that's the only thing I can say that's good about them.All that being said, I will never ever deal with Amazon's merchants again, and will probably never visit Circuit City again. I will take my business elsewhere."
"BUYER BEWARE!!!Amazon.com zShops a great way to make money.

For the SECOND time my order was canceled because of a price mistake.  You can NEVER rely on any orders from them.
"Ordered a Sandisk Ultra II 512M compact flash card as soon as I see it is on stock. On the website it stated that the order should be shipped in 1-2 weeks. After 2 weeks check again, backordered to until July! What the heck I need that for after 3 months? The worst thing is that they never send me a message about the backorder. Am I suppose to check the website everyday for the order status?I send them an email complaining but got no replay.My previous experience with Amazon.com is good but this time amazon.com looks like a shabby small online store."
"Free shipping on what I orginally purchased, then due to a price mistake on their end they removed 3 of my items bring my total to below $25.  On the remaining two items they charged me for shipping.  They did this all after the order had shipped so I could not cancel the remaining items.  They also never told me they they were going to charge me shipping, they just charged my credit card for the amount plus shipping without my consent.They have now refunded me my shipping cost."
"I am utterly disappointed with amazon due to my current order.On April 11, 2004 I placed order for two items.1) Fujifilm 128mb xD card 2) Sony NiMH charger.I had already mailed amazon regarding the charger, it was in stock when i ordered it.But I was later informed that it's back ordered (that too, after I mailed Customer support about it).Eventually I had to cancel the item since it's probable date extended till June 19 !!!!!Next, the xD cards's estimated delivery was 21 Apr, but as of 04/26 I have not received my xD card.The worst part is that the USPS tracking system hasn't updated the status of my package since Apr 15.I needed the card for my trip over the weekend, but thanx to amazon, my plans have been ruined.now i am not sure if i will at least receive the package before Apr 30, which is when i am leaving the country for a month.Also there was no reply to my mail regarding this issue (Amazon site says that the turn around time is 24 hrs).I would warn all first timers to stay away from amazon till they make their CSR more transparent and at the min provide with a toll free customer service number."
STAY away from Amazon's Z shops. I ordered a Sony camera for $510. Never received it. My money is gone. Amazon will pay me a maximum of $250. Name of the Z shopper is lorainnelectronics. I can't leave my comments on Amazon site either because Amazon simply deleted that page. This guy apprantly received money for 33 camera and vanished. 
"I, too, ordered a Visiontek Xtasy 9800 Pro 256mb card for $217.88 and Amazon decided to cancel my order five days later. These kind of pricing scams are commonplace on Amazon.  Don't think just because they advertise a price that you will be able to purchase the item at that price.  In fact, I wouldn't waste your time at all on Amazon, from what I've read, this isn't an isolated incident."
"I ordered a Visiontek Xtasy 9800 Pro 256mb card for $217.88 and Amazon said I would get the card in three to four weeks. They canceled my order on 10/04 after selling the cards to other people at $483-these orders were filled because my order was a 24hr sale, Amazon refused to ship me a card. This whole sale was a illegal scam that Amazon cooked up to bring in more sales by bait and switch. Using a low priced video card,so you go to Amazons site.Amazon is made up of lairs and you should never buy anything from them."
"I bought a 4-pack of 16-ct of Senseo Coffee Pods on Amazon's web site. Instead I got 1 pack of 16-ct of those coffee pods. Upon contacting Amazon about the issue I was told that the item was sold by J&R; I need to deal with them directly. I hate being sent from one place to another. If I placed my order on Amazon, I should be helped by someone from Amazon. While I am still trying to resolve this with J&R; now, I am very dissatisfied with Amazon's customer service."
"I ordered some scotch glasses from them and UPS shipped them to the wrong address (they had the right address on file...it was just a mistake). This wouldn't be so bad normally, I called UPS they told me of their mistake and then said to me ""oh, you ordered this from Amazon? We have to refer you to them, we have an agreement with Amazon to let them handle all their customer complaints."" She then proceeds to give me the generic web address for Amazon's 'contact us' page, and I ask ""Isn't there a phone number for me to call?"" and I am told that this is all Amazon gave them to pass along to customers. So I fill out the form email and tell Amazon what has transpired, the next day I get an email telling me that they will issue a refund as soon as the package comes back...who says it's ever going to come back?!? They then proceed to tell me that if I still want the glasses, I can reorder them...why would I pay a second time for something I did not get? Why can't Amazon either tell UPS to get the package back and deliver it to the correct address, or at least allow UPS to deal with customers directly when it was a UPS mistake? If the package ever gets back to Amazon (maybe the people at this other address that it went to really like the glasses), the credit to my Visa won't post until the next month, so that means that I am likely to be paying interest on my purchase (that I don't have) for at least 2 months and on the new purchase if I were to reorder! This is unacceptable. The package went to another address in my town and I intend to go over and politely ask for it back...which is what I should have done in the first place. I only hope that they haven't had time to give it back to UPS during the 2 days I have wasted trying to let Amazon and UPS deal with the problem. I will think twice before ordering from Amazon again because, while it was not their mistake, they seem to be doing everything in their power to prevent me from solving it."
"Sloooooowwwwwwwwwww shipping. It takes Amazon weeks to send out my orders. my previous two orders had not shipped after two weeks so I canceled them and purchased elsewhere. I though maybe the reason for the slow shipping was that I had selected Amazons free shipping, so I placed another order and selected regular paid shipping. It's been 10 days and nothing has been shipped."
"I logged on and ordered the Gateway M275 tablet/laptop and decided to have it rush ordered to me so I could get 2 days later. My current laptop is on its way out, and I can't take notes in class with it (30 minute battery life), so this new one is crucial for my study habbits.After selecting the laptop, entering in billing info, and submitting the order, I recieved a conformation e-mail. Great.The next day at about 8:00am, I recieved an e-mail saying that I had provided them with the wrong billing address. Of course I am at work at 8, so I got it when I came home. I promptly corrected my mistake, and e-mailed it to them.The next day, after waiting until around noon to hear back from them, I filled out some support tickets on their website with the correct billing information, and didn't hear back.On saturday, I called the number on their WHOIS info, and got their legal department who referred me to their customer support line. I talked to them for about 5 minutes, and he thanked me for the correct information and sent it to sales. He said I should hear back in a couple of days.Fast forward 2 days until monday, I still have had no calls back, no e-mails back, and my account is still deactiviated. I called them up and asked them what the deal was. The lady said that nobody had taken a look at my billing correction yet, and that she didn't no how much longer I would have to wait. I told her to cancel the order.I then proceded to go online and create a new account, and re-purchace the laptop. I get a confirmation e-mail thanking me, yada yada. Great.So I go and log into my account today to see whether or not it has shipped yet, and I am told my new account does not exist by the website. I call up amazon and tell them my problem, and they said that my account is still active, and that they don't know what is going on.I ask them about the status of my order, and she said it was canceled yesteday (the same day I placed the new order), and that she will put in an inquiry to sales about why it was canceled.Great, now I am back where I started."
"Ordered an iRiver iHP 120 20 GB MP3 Jukebox for 330.00 on Feb. 6th. It is now Feb 18th and just received an email that the shipment will be delayed and won't ship until April. APRIL! WTF! I've been waiting almost 2 weeks for this to arrive. I'd say it's already been delayed. Once again these big on-line merchants become too big and could give a sh_t about the customer. Well Amazon this was my last order. When your profits fall off and your stock tanks, I'll be laughing my ass off."
"Worst service I have ever received on the internet or in a real store.  The product received was not what was listed.  Brought this to customer service attention and product is still listed.  Customer service is terrible and only offer ""canned"" responses.  I purchased 2 different items at different times and have had problems with both.  The listings were not correct on either on.  Both are being returned.  I will never buy from them again."
"Amazon.com Customer Support is now in Gurgaon, India. This will turn out to be a big mistake for them. Complex issues (They have sold me a product which apparently does not exist because the item, sold from a partner, has been incorrectly labeled and coded and there are more than one interpretation of the product) cannot be solved from India. Circular reasoning, no phone number, no understanding of the issues. This will be a disaster for them."
They return policy is crappy.  It is taking 2 months to credit my account and they charged 8 dollars to return something.
"I placed an order at Amazon.com using my credit card that works fine on every other website... and one week later got an email saying that there was an ""issue"" with the credit card and to resubmit it.  Sending email to customer service results in a canned response that does nothing to resolve the problem.  They don't have ANY way to speak with a live rep on the phone.  In short, they don't provide ANY actual customer service.  This is the second time in two months I've tried to order through Amazon... the last time I just went to Barnes and Noble and had no problem.  I guess I'll do that again.    "
"I pick two items before I read it all the way, I accidently push the buuton this morning.Since than I am trying to cancel my order, no luck.Amazon.com ""so called the biggest online retailer"" don't even have a listed phone on line to call. One of my worst nightmare. Be aware from all those free shipping ads.Never never again."
"Amazon.com has very poor customer service and inaccurate in-stock information. It took them 9 days to tell me that an item that I ordered was not in stock and in fact will never be in stock. They cancelled my order completely. After that, a gift certificate that I redeemed for that purchase could no longer be used. I have $50 worth of gift certificate that I cannot access. I emailed customer service and they just give me the generic responses on how to use gift certificates. Unfortunately you cannot call Amazon.com on the phone. I could probably get this issue resolved in about 5 minutes on the phone rather than waiting days for email replies.I would recommend NOT buying from Amazon.com for two reasons: 1)Poor customer service 2)You can find better prices elsewhere using sites such as www.pricewatch.com www.bestbookbuys.com"
"I ordered a HP iPAQ FA109A#AC3 USB Desktop Cradle for $44.99 and after waiting for a long 1 week I get a message stating: ""We are sorry to report that we will not be able to obtain the following item from your order..."" ""...we've since found that it is not available from any of our sources at this time"".Yet when I got to their web site and search for FA109A#AC3, the product is available for purchase, but at an increase price of $75!!!..  I was able to add the item to my shopping cart and stopped just short of placing the order.These guys are frauds, DO NOT BUY FROM them if you expect to receive the items you've ordered.  They will not send the items they have in stock if they think they can sell them for higher price the next day."
"I've only ordered once from Amazon and it'll be the last time. The games are in stock, the order was placed two weeks ago and they still haven't shipped them yet. Other companies, offering the same Fedex Saver shipping, have managed to get me my orders more than a week ago. Their treatment of my order is an obvious attempt to sell more premium shipping options. Under the statement ""free Fedex Saver shipping"" they ought to state that their going to hold your order for weeks to get that perk.   Sincerely, irritated one time customer"
"Ordered an item as a Christmas gift on 12/14. Listed as ships within 24 hours. Found out 12/24 that the item hadn't shipped until 12/22 and would take 8 days to arrive. (It took 6 emails to the seller and almost 2 weeks to get this info.) I paid for expidited shipping, and to me 16 days is not expidited, the item was shipped standard ground. Needless to say this gift was not here in time for the holiday. In fact Fed Ex estimated arrival date is 12/30. I would avoid this seller, unless time is not an issue. Even then considering the rating I've seen on here and other sites, they misrepresent shipping terms often. "
"Placed order on Dec 6.  ""Usually shipsin 24 hours""... Got confirmation thatit shipped Dec 16.  Now this orderwas Christmas gifts.  I thought noproblem 12/16-12/24 is plenty of timeto go 1 state.  Well if they actually shipped it, then it would.  USPSconfirms this order wasnt shipped onthe 16th.  So I'm out of luck.  5 emailsand 1 phone call starting 12/23 and I gotno help.If timing is urgent avoid this retailer."
"I placed an order around Nov. 1, 2003. I received an e-mail on 12/19/03 of a new ship date of Jan 18, 2003. I cancelled the order!"
"the oreder was placed on Dec 6 for 2 items with ""usual shipped within 24 hours"" availability with super saving shipping options. promised shipping day Dec 15. Today is Dec 18 - it is still not shipped and now they change the shipping date to Dec 20. Wrote to them, got 2 e-mail from Mohit Sharma and Nitin Chahar. Sounds like Indians to me. It looks like the amazon has transferred their cust support to India (like Dell did and was sorry about it and cancelled it later). That would explain the worthless customer support. Their e-mail are useless, copy-and-paste from some kind of manual. I got the same paragraph twice in the same e-mail. And my order is still not shipped. whatever supposed to be a christmass present and ordered 3 weeks in advance doubtedly can make it her before new year. way to go, amazon.com!!!"
Amazon sent email stating order total as $70.95.The actual order was $40.97.Items that bundled for free were not free in the email conformation.Customer service claims email conformation is wrong.Order has been in processing for 3 days. 
"Once upon a time I believed Amazon.com to be a great company. Their prices and service were absolutely great. Recently I have had cause to reconsider my opinion.For the past two years Amazon.com has seen fit to botch my Christmastime order. Last year I ordered around 10 items totaling several hundred dollars in merchandise, all of which was guaranteed to be delivered by Christmas. Apparently there was a problem with one item, so Amazon saw fit to delay my entire order until that one item arrived. So instead of a guaranteed Christmas delivery I received all my Christmas presents in January. All the time this was going on my order sat in limbo, unable to be canceled because it was being filled. The point to this is that Amazon.com violated two FTC laws regarding catalog and internet sales. You cannot hold someones order for over a month without nofifying them of a problem. Secondly you MUST give your customer the option to cancel the order if you delay the order for a month. They did neither of these things, and now I am regreting the fact that I didn't file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.Now comes this Christmas. I ordered a DVD/VCR combo player on October 31st. The player was listed as in stock shipping in 1-2 days. When I purchased the player I used a $30 gift certificate that I had received with my Amazon.com credit card. So two weeks go by and the player has not been shipped. I get an email from Amazon stating that there has been a problem in obtaining the DVD player and I need to approve a delay in my order. I went to the Amazon.com page for the DVD player and sure enough the status of the player had gone from ""in stock ships in 1-2 days"" to ""out of stock, more in soon."" Now obviously they never had the player in stock in the first place. If I don't want to suffer the delay I have the option of canceling the order, but then I would lose my $30 gift certificate. So I approve the delay, and after another two weeks my delivery estimate has now gone to January of next year. This is no good for a Christmas Present.SOOO, I email their customer service department and request that they change my order from the DVD player I ordered to another one that was IN STOCK. They refused to do so. I have to cancel my current order, and replace it for another DVD player. BUT since they have jerked me around for a month the $30 gift certificate I used in the original order has since expired and cannot be reused in my new order.Now what do you think of a company that treats their customers this. They could have shipped part of my order instead of sitting on the whole thing last year. They could have obeyed the laws of The United States of America. They could have had their stock listed correctly. They could have admitted that they had made a mistake and corrected it. Instead, each and every time, Amazon.com chose to screw me over as a customer. I say to you beware, sooner or later this will happen to you."
"Lied about shipping information. BUYER BEWARE! Shipping info is FALSE. I ordered two day shipping, and my order will not be here until the 1st of DEC!!!!!!!  5 days after shipping!RIPOFF!!!!!!"
"Amazon is ok for regular orders, but their policies for their 3rd party sellers is terrible and their customer service is non-existant.  I ordered from a place that turned out to be clearly bogus and they refused to get involved.  I will never deal with their 3rd party sellers again, unless their customer service improves.  If you have a problem you will not be able to get any help from their customer support and they refuse to give out phone numbers.  "
"During my shopping experience I placed an order with Amazon.com for a pair of hiking boots.  I went through all of the ordering, got my confirmation, and then about a week later I emailed customer support to see where my product was.  They said it had been cancelled because it was ""out of stock"".  On their website it said that it was in stock.  Then, they just cancel it without even sending me an email.  I had to email them to figure out that my order was cancelled.  First of all you can't just cancel a customers order like that.  Second of all not even notifying them is even worse."
"Very bad experience with customer service.  They failed to properly apply the credit from the gift card I used for the purchase.  Amazon refused to correct the problem, charging my credit card the full amount.  They said I would have to refuse the shipment or send it back and place the order all over again.  Very poor service especially considering their prices are not competitive.  They don't deserve my business again."
"I recently made a purchase through Amazon.com.  They charged my credit card, and sent me an order confirmation.  One week latter they canceled my order and refunded my credit card without ever providing a reason for the cancelation.  I sent several inquiries to customer service and have yet to receive an explanation.If you want anything other than a main-stream book, I'd shop elsewhere."
"I just ordered a piece of clothing from Amazon(actually Sportrus.com).    New to Amazon, in trying to review the order, I slipped up and submitted it prematurely.   Now the fun part:   I tried for 15 min. to cancel it somehow online:  no cancel box,  no phone number, nothing.   Just some criptic comment on 'No refunds from Marketplace sellers'.     Whoever they are.   Guess what:  Sportsrus is one of them.   So I call these folks twice, last hearing that 'We only upload orders once a day...and by then most people aren't able to cancel'.  Do you believe that for one minute?   Two calls to Amazon.  The first one: ...(fumble fumble) 'I have Sportsrus'phone number somewhere'.   The second one (it tookover 30 min.) had the supervisor say to me:  'Go call them and ask for a refund in full...goodbye and good luck'.   Click.   Wish me luck."
"i have been very satisfied with Amazon til my recent order. it was the most terrible experience with online shopping. i ordered a book on Amazon.co.uk on Sept 14, 03 and was told that i should see the book at my front door on Sept 30 (oversea shipping). as of that day, instead of the book i received an email from them saying that they didnt even get the book from the publisher (ridiculously, at the time i ordered, it was showed up as in stock and ""24 hours availablity""). and they didnt even bother to informed me during about that during 15 days (Sept 14 - sept 29). how could it take that long (15 days) for them to find out that the book is not instock???ok, they promised to get it on October 13 and the book should be on my hand on Oct 22 (WTF??). on Oct 08, i tracked the status of the order and it was still as ""not yet dispatched"". then i emailed them to ask if it has been obtained from the supply yet. today Oct 10 they sent me an email answering my two-day-ago email that they are sorry that they didnt inform me earlier that the book has been backordered and they dont know when they are gonna get it. i guess if i didnt email them to ask about the book on Oct 08, they would let me wait until Oct 22 to send me another email like the one they sent me on Sept 29. terrible. in short, it took them a month just to realize that they dont have what they are selling and the thing that pissed me off the most was that they didnt bother to tell the customers about the change of the trasaction until the last day. they have no idea about the definition of ""customer"" at all"
"What a JOKE! I ordered the JVC AV-48WP74 48"" Widescreen HD-Ready Projection Television from them on Sept 16th. I have been waiting for it to ship up until today when they cancelled my order. They are no better than any other bait-and-switch e-tailer. Their reason was that they could not get the TV from the distributor. Well, that means that they were selling something that they didn't have. "
"My problem with amazon was that I never actually placed an order. The page was having problems and I was researching an order.  I left the order page open, never confirmed the order, next thing I know I have an email from amazon confirming my purchase.  When I tried to cancel my order, amazon said it was not possible because I placed the order with the actual company from which the merchandise was being shipped.  I never placed any order!!! I filed several complaints with amazon - response: It was out of their hands.  Why would I be able to place an order through amazon, but not cancel it? Ridiculous. Amazon has not been helpful at all, and they've been experiencing problems with their webpage throughout this problem, therefore increasing my frustration.I will not shop with amazon.com again because they have no concept of customer service."
"I ordered several items from Amazon recently.  I ordered the Belkin Tunecast (ships from J&R; Music and Computer World) and a bunch of Audio CD's.  I wanted to get them before I drive my sister to the East coast, so I had the order shipped via 2nd day delivery.  I got the cd's on Tuesday(8/19/2003), but the Belkin Tunecast is being shipped to me via GROUND!   It won't be here until 8/26/2003 or next Tuesday. What kinda crap is this?  I am sooo pissed.  I will NEVER buy from Amazon.com AGAIN!!! This is total bullshit."
"Amazon offers great prices on their items, but good luck getting it!!!  I've ordered from amazon.com many many times; always using their free super saver shipping.  They intentionally hold your item for a few days to make sure their (ship paying) customers get their items first!! On top of this, my orders always get delayed.  I order mostly electronics, like most others do.  As of right now, I am still waiting for my lexar memory stick.  This will be my FINAL purchase from amazon.com.  I hope they will change shipping policy for their own sake."
"I ordered 3 differnet time from them. Yes they have awesome prices but their shipping takes about 1 week to get there. On my 3rd try, I ordered a stero system. They said it was in stock, but now they dont and I've waited 1 month for it. Their prices are great, but compared to other stores, i rather fork over 2 dollars to acutally get my stuff within a week. One flaw of their companey and they arent very consumer directed because of such high status companey. I would recommend amazon for small purchases but never fork over more then 100 dollars for a single product because you'll never get it."
"I ordered a Samsung 1100DF 21"" monitor from Amazon thinking that it would be safe and I wouldn't have any problems.  Boy was I wrong.  The first monitor came and it was literally beat all to hell.  Something had punctured the box and hit the front of the monitor just above the screen.  Whatever it was hit it really hard because the plastic was cracked and the screen inside was shattered.  The box was all beat to hell too when I first got it, so that should have been my first clue.  So I get a return label and send it back.  This was after waiting over a week to get it.  So they don't ship out the replacement until another week has passed and they actually have the first one back even though they could look at the tracking and see that it was on its way back.  So fine, whatever.  They ship the replacement 2nd day and I have it in about five days because they shipped it UPS right before a weekend.  So finally the new one comes and the box is just literally destroyed.  It's been torn all to hell and taped back up with shipping tape.  I opened it while the driver was still there and the styrofoam inside was all busted up and all over the place and the monitor was just flopping around in the box.  It had obviously been dropped several times because the plastic corners on the front were all dented up.  So I refused delivery and told Amazon I wanted to cancel the order and get my money refunded.  I thought that would be the end of it...but no.  First they refuse to even process the refund until the monitor is actually back there even though the tracking said I refused delivery and it was on its way back.  So they get it back...and no refund.  After a week I wrote to them and asked them what the hell was going on.  They write back and tell me that it takes 7 to 14 days to process the refund and if I didn't get it in 4 weeks to write back to them.  NOW THAT'S FREAKIN PATHETIC!  I was the one that got screwed over here and now they're holding my money hostage!  I had it on a credit card and I can't get the finance charge removed until they refund the money and the bill's due pretty soon here.  So lesson learned.  Never buy a big ticket item from Amazon unless you want to get royally screwed.Update: I called Amazon's so called customer service.  The first call resulted in me finding out that after they had the monitor back for a week, they still hadn't issued me a refund.  The lady on the phone said that she would issue the refund request and that I should have it within a few days.  A few days passed but still no refund.  I called back and found out that the lady who put it in didn't even have the authority to put in the request because of the dollar amount, yet they didn't correct this and take care of the problem, nor did they contact me and let me know this.  Several more calls later and I finally got a supervisor to take care of it, and it still took several more days to get my refund.  All in all it took them 21 days after they received the monitor back to issue me the refund.  Riciculous and incompetent.  I have since ordered the monitor from a reputable company."
"I USED to be a regular customer of Amazon.com - until I experienced their incompetence with online transaction processing.  It is better if I explain this situation by copying and pasting the letter I had to send to my bank because of the transaction processing problems with Amazon.com. I am trying to find other people that this has happened to.  Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to dispute the charges for my overdrafts and charges that occurred to my account through Amazon.com.  When I went to order these books (see attached documentation) I wanted to use my credit card, not my debit card.  However, when I was in the ordering screens, they never asked for my billing method nor to confirm purchase.  They simply went from the shipping screen immediately to the purchase confirmation screen.  I am very experienced with the internet and I know that I did NOT do this, it was their mistake.  What they did is they used an account number that I had in my profile and did NOT have authorization to do this.  I IMMEDIATELY called them to rectify the situation because I knew that I did not have enough in my account to cover this charge. I wanted to use my credit card instead.  They would not and refused to help me by reversing the charges.  They said that I had to go through the individual owners of the books since I was purchasing them as used books – even though they were acting as an agent for these purchases!  I did this and eventually the charges were reversed, however, not without incurring overdraft charges. An order of used books for 34.00 now cost me over 120.00.  I called (my bank) to notify them that these charges were never authorized and they stated that they could not help me.  Finally, after being on the phone with about 5 different representatives for over an hour, I was able to get a gentleman that was of some assistance, although he could not reverse the charges.  He said that I should notify your department and ask that the overdrafts be reversed.  I have attached the information pertaining to this and I am greatly distraught at this situation.  I no longer will be using Amazon.com for any books that I purchase.  I believe that it was deceptive and incompetent to take me directly to the purchase confirmation screen without asking my permission or to choose which account I wanted billed for this – although they had two accounts in my profile. How did they know which one to bill?  I have since removed my information and will never trust Amazon.com to ever have such privileged information again.  I think that (my bank) should put Amazon.com on an investigative status as to their billing practices and technological incompetence.  I am sure that there were others who this happened to and it should be investigated fully.  I am on unemployment and I cannot afford to pay such horrendous fees while I am trying to get an education and get a decent job.  I would like to have these charges reversed, possibly billed to Amazon.com if that is possible for their mistake that I should not be responsible for.  I should not have to pay for this, especially when I was trying to save money by purchasing used books.  Please let me know if you need any more information or have any questions."
"Amazon's customer support is terrible, especialy if you have a corporate account.  Amazon's regular customer support says there is no way to contact their Corporate accounts division other that for them to send a form.  Their credit dept, however, is most helpful by giving a direct 800 number to contact the corporate dept directly even though the regular customer service says it doesn't exist.  Don't even think about trying to talk to a supervisor because they won't let you.  They have to fill out a form and have them contact you.  In the three years I have dealt with Amazon, no one has ever called me back.  Don't try to cancel an order because they have to fill out a form and will get back to you.  They still ship the order and then hope you'll keep it and not have to worry about it.  As to their own admission, Amazon wants to hadle all problems using forms and email; to which they do not respond.  Be very cautious dealing with them."
"I ordered a 20PK of OEM Soundblaster cards for $39.99. The order was processed and was shipped to my house. When I recieved the package, there was only 1 card in there. Amazon shafted me 19 cards. I call up Amazon and ask them where my 19 cards are, they say there was a mistake on their website and that the price was for a single card. So instead of alerting me of their mistake and cancelling my order, they send it out to me and then tell me they'll refund my order in full. Yet, I have to waste my time packing up and sending the stupid card back. I figured I wasn't getting anywhere with Amazon, so I let my CC company handle it.Months pass, I get a letter from my CC company saying I have to return the card or keep it and have my CC charged. So I figure, screw it, I don't care anymore. I go to Login at Amazon and tada, my account DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE. Where did it go? No one at Amazon will give me a straight story other than I must have violated one of their ""Terms of Service."" The worst service ever. I get no compensation for their error, their tech support is incompetent, Amazon is horrible. I will never be ordering from them again."
"I placed an order while amazon had a promo ""Purchase $99 or more of Kitchen & Housewares products offered by Amazon.com and receive $20 off a future Amazon.com purchase"".  The offer states, ""we will e-mail you (at the e-mail address you have specified in your account) a promotional code within four weeks of the purchase."" --- I even told several friends about the deal and they took advantage of it as well.  It has now been SIX WEEKS (they said four), and I have not received anything.  I checked with my friends and they have also received NOTHING.  What's the problem?  The check is in the (e)mail?  This is outright FRAUD on amazon's part.  We are considering a class-action suit against them."
"I placed an order for a Toshiba laptop about a month ago. When I was trying to connect on-line I had some problems. I called Toshiba customer service and they were unable to help me (excellent service department by the way). They told me the computer probably needed repair. I contacted Amazon.Com to return the laptop and get a new one. I am still waiting... Amazon stated they would send me a call tag so I could send the laptop back. I e-mailed them back because I never got the call tag. I received another -computer generated reply- stating they would send me another call tag. Again, I had to e-mail them because they never picked up the laptop. Finally, I called their customer service department (awful two out of three calls I had to make). Nobody was able to solve my problem. I asked to talk to a supervisor and two times I got the same response: ""their job is not to answer phone calls."" Obviously the company teaches this to them. The last time I called I asked for an address where I could return the laptop, even if I had to pay for the shipment myself. The answer I got was: ""you will just have to wait for our computer department to call you back in 2 to 4 days. You are going to have to be patient."" ... even after 20 days and 6 attempts??? Customer service at Amazon.Com definitely needs improvement!!!"
"Totally unacceptable! I ordered a blender that was in stock and according to Amazon “usually ships in 24 hours.” On May 6th, 48 hours later, while checking the status of the order online, I noticed that the order was on hold pending an updated credit card expiration date. There was no problem with the date and the card should have worked with the information provided. I was forced to use a second credit card so the order could proceed. I was never notified that there was any problem and if it were not for me checking on the status, the order would still be frozen.I contacted customer support. By the way, there is no phone number listed anywhere on the Web site. It took a Web search to find the number from someone else who had gotten the number after writing the company. For those interested, the number is 800-201-7575. Customer support was no help. They could not tell me why the order got delayed. But, they assured me that the item was in the process of being shipped.I checked the Web site and confirmed that my item was being prepared to ship. The expected ship date (the date that it is due to be sent out, not the day I am expected to receive it) was May 14th. I figured that this had to be some kind of mistake. Surely, an item that usually ships in 24 hours could not take 10 days to ship. I decided to check the status the next day and see if it had been sent out. To my surprise, the item had still not been sent but the expected ship date had been changed to May 12th. I contacted customer support again to confirm the ship date. They confirmed that the item was still being prepared for shipment and that the expected ship date was May 12th. I was very upset. I asked why it was taking so long to prepare for shipment. The reply was that I selected free super saver shipping and therefore my order would take several days before it ships.This is totally unacceptable. I have ordered from companies like NewEgg and Z-Buy using super saver shipping and have usually received the items within 3 days (and Z-Buy was shipping the item from New York to California). I will never order from Amazon again and do not recommend them to anyone for anything."
"Box came earlier than their suggested date.  Box packed well, but after opening i noticed the box set had some damage to the side of the package.  Also ""holographic card"" did not come with the DVD even though the sticker was on the dvd itself.  I can not return for a new one because the DVD isn't in the original plastic."
"1st order a while back (did not rate them then-should have!) I ordered a book,that they said they had 18 in stock, 3 weeks after order got an Email stating they never had any and apollogized! This present order made on 3/26th/2003 for another book (gave them 2nd chance). They Emailed me and stated there would be a delay,that it might come in by May 5th., and would I authorize the delay, and foolishly I did! Email came yesterday for another delay for me to authorize, and because I need this book so bad, foolishly did! But, this time I started to disagree with their business practises with me for the 2nd time. They gave me a bunch of ""cop outs"" and excuses, really didn't seem to care, and advised me that I could cancel this order. I stated that I would sleep on that. I also stated that I have printed out all Emails, and would endeavor to show them to others to prevent other ""victims"". They offered me overnight shipping to make up for their miscues---I stated that's like adding insult to injury!!! Today I cancelled my order---I believe they're glad to get rid of me. For me to say that I'm ""Very Dissatisfied"" would be a great understatement!!!!!!!! "
"Ordered a TV on March 29, It says usually ships in 1-2 weeks. They give me an estimate of april 14 for the shipping date, waited till April 22 and then they changed the estimated delievery date to May 22. There is no way to contact the customer service for this order. "
"Amazon.com sucks!About March 3rd I made an international order for over $1,000.  I immediately found out that when they make these estimates of orders shipping in 24 hours it must be because they are on drugs.  Almost a week later, my order shipped.  Negligence.Their Web site states that international orders that are for more than $400 ship via trackable methods.  Now, as of April 18th, the order is nowhere to be found.  Come to find out they didn't ship via a trackable method.  More negligence.After dealing with their customer service people via e-mail, it took a complaint to the Better Business Bureau to force a refund.  However, since I have a foreign currency credit card (not US dollars), the exchange rate variation between the day my order was charged and the day they issued the refund meant I lost about $50.  Amazon refuses to be responsible even though had they lived up to their obligation to ship my order via a trackable method the problem never would have happened.Dealing with their customer service staff is horrible.  Most are not literate in English.  Their reading comprehension skills are worse than a cat's.  The vast majority of them are migrant workers from India or Pakistan.You'd have to be a moron to order from Amazon.com."
"These people are dishonest in my opinion and sneaky.  I placed an order for 5 books with them and then realized i had forgotten one...went back and looked over their policies and they had an option to combine orders...I followed their instructions explicitly...placed the order for the extra book, went to my account, and selected combine orders, immediately after placing order and it brought up both orders, the instructions on that page said  that in order to combine orders click the combine order button below to see which can be combined.  NO BUTTON!!  but I did click the view order button of the new order for the one book and it said this order is being prepared for shipping...it was being prepared for shipping immediately after placing it?  WHat this crooks need to state in their instructions is if you are buying from one of their retailers, and not a used book or whatever, then THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN COMBINE THE ORDERS because we immediately place the product in the shipping process, even tho we are CLOSED...what a ripoff....granted it was minimal amount of shipping they ripped me off for, but it is the principle...these people are dishonest.....the bright side?...the new order I placed....the people they are representing could not take payment...from amazon  ""In this case, the seller is currently unable to accept payment.Amazon Marketplace items must be paid for via Amazon.com Payments.Since the seller is temporarily unable to receive payment by that means, please search our site for an available copy of this item from another seller, or return and attempt to purchase from this seller again at a later time.""  what kind of people is this company representing?????won't do business with them ever again...very very misleading."
"I found a Radeon 9000 Pro 128MB video card THROUGH THIS WEBSITE advertised for $89.99 . When I hit the purchase button, I was taken to a different list, with the lowest price being $113.59. I wrote Amazon a letter, and was told by them ""Pricing policies are determined by the individual merchant, and not by Amazon.com, so I would encourage you to contact them directly with any questions about price."" and they directed me to a different business. That company, J&R; Music and Computers, sold the same card for $129.99 and they would not honor any price that was advertised. Stay away from this business."
"Placed order using gift certificate. I have no credit card on the account. Amazon placed rhe order on hold because the credit card nmber expired? WHAT CREDIT CARD? They have not responsed to mutiple emails asking them to ship.Bad company, Bad selection.I won't use a credit card cause I won't do business once gift is gone."
"I ordered a T-mobile Samsung v205 Cellphone from Amazon on the 5th, site said usually ships within 24hrs. It has been over a week now and it has still not been shipped. No customer support # anywhere on the site.... just an email form. I keep emailing them and all I get back is a message aying there has been a processig error... and the estimated ship date keep moving up. I though these where the 'BIG BOYS!' obviously I was mistaken. This company sucks royaly! I just got an email from them asking if I would like to approve the delay, where it would ship by the 18th. 13 days to ship a phone? Is it out of stock? I wouldnt mind the deay if they would just be straigt up and give me a real answer to the cause of the delay instead of sending me BS emails. I work for a cellular company too, but cant get the same price after rebates amazon offers... ONLY RESON IM WAITING...ONLY!"
"Amazon's one click ordering resulted in duplicate orders.  Even though the website indicates orders can be cancelled prior to shipment, this is not true.  Amazon has no phone number for customer service.  Even though the order has not shipped, Amazon's e-mail response is that nothing can be done.  I have faxed their legal number and e-mailed them.  Be careful about placing orders with this company.  "
"Horrible! Need to call Amazon about your order? They want you to stay away! Their new policy is to hide their phone number. After your order is placed, you can't get the number on their website (800-201-7575). Should anything go wrong with your order, you are on your own!"
"Horrible experience.  I would not recommend this company to anyone.  Was not shipped the right quantity of what I ordered, and they are refusing me to what I ordered for the right price.   Good ole bait and switch by amazon.com, stealing customers money.  Horrible customer service. "
Customer Service was horrible.  Customer is never right.  I will never buy from them again.
"I had originally placed an order for an all-clad cop-r-chef pot at $129 along with a global 8"" chef knife at $77. Both were listed as free shipping and garaunteed delivery before xmas as they were both going to be gifts. I received a confirmation email that my order was being proccessed that day.I had also at this time been placing alot of orders recently for xmas gifts and parts to an xmas computer and was already having various problems with some vendors like SVCompucycle and LiveWareHouse in receiving the last of my computer parts. I had a small hiccup with newegg even on my CPU for my computer but like the awsome company they were they immediately remedied the situation and resent it back out overnight at no charge to me.Well since all this was happening I had almost forgotten the order I placed with amazon. On 12/20/02 I decided to check my order status and see where it was at. When I checked my account and order history on amazon my order was not listed. I re-checked my email and I noticed there was no order number after carefully re-reading it and all it really said was thank your for ordering with amazon. I was a little dumbfounded but gave amazon the benefit of the doubt and assumed it was my fault. I thought maybe I hadn't hit the final submit button or something correctly.With that I mind I re-ordered everything but by this time I had to select 2dn day premium shipping and pay $17 more then what I had originally anticipated. I get an email this time for my order along with an actuall order number. I figured everything was going well and left it at that. I get another email saturday, 12/21/02, showing my order had shipped. I figured it should be here monday 12/23/02. I was wrong.Since it didn't show up I figured I would check online again and find out where it was. When I look online what should I behold? My ORIGINAL ORDER WAS FINALLY LISTED! I then noticed I got ANOTHER email for my first order along with it's order number and showing it's now in process. It also should the original purchase date of 12/14/02.Now at this point I was really, really upset because I just found out that my original order was NOT my fault and I had to pay an extra $17 bucks for premium shipping that I shouldn't have had to do in the first place.I sent an email to amazon stating this in the first place and asked if I could be refunded my shipping charges since it was THEIR fault. I received a reply email stating all they could do was cancel my original order and they couldn't refund me the cost of my shipping I had paid because my order had already shipped.This is complete and utter BULLLSHYT!!! Never ever EVER will I do business again with amazon. I have in the past bought a lot from them including my expensive school books and supplies. I've spent over a thousand bucks there in the last 6 months and they can't even behave like any other reputable online company and refund my measly $17 bucks.Oh and on top of that, scheduled delivery for my xmas gifts with ""garaunteed"" delivery by 12/24 is 12/30. Just F8cking great Amazon. Way to ruin my xmas. Go to hell."
"I placed my order on December 10th, 2002. My delivery was slated for the 19th-21st of December. (I paid for two day shipping $11.97) and according to Amazon's website's tracking page, my product was shipped the 18th: ""Dec 18, 2002 08:51:49 PM FERNLEY NV US SHIPPED"" So if it was shipped the 18th, I should have received it on the 20th. It didn't show up, I went throught the customer service form e-mail b.s., and received a response e-mail.In the e-mail I received from Keith Adamson (their rep.), he stated that ""As your package was sent on Thursday December 19, it should arrive by the end of business on Monday."" However, it is now Tuesday, December 24th and I still have not received my order. These items are Christmas gifts (and why I placed my order on the 10th and paid for two day shipping) and they will not arrive in time for Christmas. It has been two weeks since I placed my order on December 10th. I am disappointed that I chose to purchase from Amazon and will further conduct my shopping at Buy.com where I have never had any problems. Amazon has left a bad first impression. "
Purchased in-stock gifts to be delivered prior to christmas.  After a seven day wait received notification that some of the products ordered had not been sent and would not be sent until after christmas. This delay prevents the purchase and timely delivery from an alternate vendor.
"Three years ago Amazon was incredible, packages were shipped on time and would only take 2 days to get to me. Now all they do is disappoint me over and over. The free shipping is a joke, they should call it the wait a month and then we'll ship it free shipping. Even regular shipping is a joke, it is going to take 1.5 weeks for me to get my package of very common items.After 4 years as an Amazon customer I will not longer be using their services.UPDATE: Amazon still sucks. I don't pay for shipping they send my stuff with a week long delay. I do pay for shipping and they send it via USPS that takes more than a week, thats insulting. From now on I will be taking my business elsewhere if I can find the same product for the same price or less. "
"I am extremely dissatisfied with my experience at amazon.com.  I attempted to order a graphics tablet from them, but had to go through email exchanges with 4 different people just to attempt to get them to not mess up my address so I could actually receive my order.  Each email I dispatched was obviosuly sent to someone who did not understand the situation and gave me back the same bogus answer every time.  They've caused me a great deal of lost time and money, and I will never deal with them again."
"I am very disatisfied with Amazon.com.  I ordered several products that were advertised as qualifing for free shipping. I then selected the Super Saver Shipping and hit the proceed button.  Afterwards, I received an invoice with Shipping Charges.  I contacted Amazon.com several times about this and included a copy of what I saw on the screen.  Each time I was told that I must select Supper Saver Shipping to qualify for the free shipping.I feel that I have been ""Baited and Switched!"
My Gold Box Showed an item for $169 and when added to the cart still showed up for $169.  However when I went to check out it jumpeed to $199.  I still had 49 minutes left to make the purchase so I know that time hadn't elasped.  I choose to not make the purchase.  I emailed them and they gave me the run around for 2 days.  Watch these bait and switch tactics.
"I had ordered PS2 Network Adapter on November 2nd.  They advertised it for 39.99 and shipping withing 5-7 days with estimated time of delivery between November 7 and 10th.  After the shipping date was moved up several times to November 25-29 and 4 e-mailes to customer service, the amazon blamed everything on an error within their system and canceled my order.  They were supposed to create a new order and ship the item.  Of course that was an easy way for Amazon to say that my new order came in after the item was sold out and they had no ETA when the item will become available again.  At this point 3 weeks later Amazon is refunding my credit card, and blaming me for placing an order for out of stock item.  I just waisted my time with Amazon thinking I was getting a great item at good price.  Buttom line is they advertise items that they don't have in stock, wait for few weeks hoping to get it in, and when its not available simply cancel the order.  Will take a hell of a deal to even think of placing an oder with this company again."
"I've order third time from amazon and probably won't do it again. My first two orders came just fine eventhough slower than expected and slower than other companies, like bookpool shipments. But this third order got just ridiculous handling at amazon. First I received several e-mails stating that they can't charge my credit card and requiring that I have to go to web site and revise my order to enter correct info about credit card. I checked with my bank, they didn't have declines, then I tried to revise the order, but web page said that it is impossible (previous page said order could not be processed until revised, how is that!) to do at this point. Then I called customer service and they told me, that this was technical problem in system and everything with my credit card is OK. Still, I verified all data with them. They apologized and assured me that everything OK now. And next day I received notification that order is cancelled. I never had that kind of experience with any company in US."
Ordered a Playstation game Oct. 11 and still haven't got it.  Amazon keeps sending out email saying it is delayed  a valid reason why.  After several emails to customer service there has not been an answer.  This could have been resolved by saying Amazon doesnt carry this item anymore or it is out of stock and offer me the choice to order something else.
"I will never order from Amazon.com again. This is the second time I have ordered from them and both times there were issues with their shipping methods and charges. I ordered two items in the most recent order and one of the items actually came from Office Depot, thus the two items carry separate shipping charges and delivery dates."
"Well, I guess I complimented them too soon. I was so happy with my Orinoco Silver order, I placed another order for a Hercules Prophetview 920 about a week later. The website said ""available in 2-3 days."" Undeterred by the quick shipping of my first order, I placed the order and noticed the supersaver shipping date of the 18th of november. Nevertheless, I waited. A week later, I sent Amazon.com an email asking why my monitor hadn't shipped within two to three days, and the answer came that in order to keep shipping costs down, it may take up to the ship date to get the cheapest shipping. The email also guaranteed me that the product would ship at the latest the 18th of November. I waited some more. And waited. And waited. On the 19th of November, I see that website now says the expected ship date is December 2. How nice. This seemed fishy to me -- like they didn't actually have it in stock. So I called Amazon.com -- I found their number not on their website but a 3rd party site -- and Burt told me that in fact, they did not have the item in stock -- since well before the 4th. I asked him politely why the website said it was in stock and he replied equally politely:""If the site does not say 'ships within 24 hours' it means that it is most likely not in stock."" Good job, Amazon, lie to the consumer. Furthermore, he stated that the estimated shipping dates are just vague guesses at when Amazon will be able to ship products based on availability. This translates to me as ""we don't know when it will ship and don't want to tell you, either."" He upgraded my shipping to 2nd day to placate me but said it would still ship on the 2nd of December because that was when Amazon.com would be receiving a shipment of these monitors. Interestingly enough -- the 12/2 is also 2 weeks away -- the same timeframe as their original estimated ship date. I don't think Amazon will be getting my product, but we'll see."
"Two issues with Amazon.  Let me start off by saying this is not the same company it was when I first started ordering from them in 1997.The first issue.  Their website advertised 1 of: Dr. Atkins' Three-Book Package: New Diet Revolution; New Diet Cookbook; New Carb Gram Counter as being updated as of January 2002.  When I received the books, the diet was 1999, and the other 2 books were copyright 1996 and 1997.  Amazon refunded me the money but kept the shipping.  Only $3.00 but the point is that I already had the 1999 copyrighted atkins book which I got from them.  I wish their website would have said the actual copyright dates.  I was under the impression the book was revised.  I explained this to them in E-mail and also in a letter I enclosed with the return. They totally ignored it and charged me the shipping.  The second issue.  The following is a copy and paste from their order tracking screen. I placed an order for a CD, order number 002-3391064-8500004Order date September 16, 2002 Items not yet shipped: Delivery estimate: November 5   I sent an E-mail to Amazon and the cust svce rep replied and gave me a round about answer that kind of stated it was out of stock, but didn't come out and tell me.  All they had to do was to have been upfront and told me the truth rather then beat around the bush.  I will never order from them again.  I will go to Borders."
"I ordered two TVs and a DVD box set from Amazon and after a week of waiting, they cancelled my order via e-mail.  In the email they only mentioned one of the televisions, but had said the order was cancelled and they could not honor the price their website listed (sounds like something Best Buy would do!).  I decided to check my order status on their website and found they cancelled the whole thing.  I replied and told them I was still waiting for the other half of my order.  They replied and said my other TV was cancelled too because of the same reason (both e-mails looked like a chimp had composed them).  If my order was cancelled, how were they able to see this?  I am very pissed that it took them SO long to inform me, not to mention their false advertising.  If this were a retail store and that price was listed out on the shelf, they would have to sell it for that price, so how does Amazon get away with this?  What would be the point of even listing prices if they choose whether or not to honor it?!  I mentioned they had cancelled my dvd order as well...  I did some checking around and found it cheaper elsewhere, so I'm glad Amazon cancelled the whole order.About 3 months ago I also ordered a Weber grill from Amazon.  Again, it was sitting - waiting to be processed for a week and a half.  During the waiting time, I received a coupon for 10% off at a local hardware store, so I cancelled the order and bought local.I am very disappointed with the order and shipping department at Amazon and I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM AMAZON AGAIN... EVER!"
"I apologize in advance that my post is somewhat lengthy, but I think it's important the story be told in full.My wife and I ordered four items (three books and a piece of software) from Amazon on August 18. All items were listed as ""in-stock"" and available to ship within 24 hours. Ten days later we hadn't received the packages yet and hadn't received shipment confirmation or a notice of delay from Amazon, so we checked the ""Your-Account"" page. Sure enough, the items hadn't even shipped yet. We emailed customer support, which gave us a boilerplate apology and no specific explanation for the delay. We were hoping Amazon would do the right thing and bump our shipping up to overnight or next-day air, but customer service made no such offer. After our prodding, the next day the items were sent out UPS ground and Airbourne.Dissatisified that Amazon wouldn't give us an answer about why the shipment was delayed so long, we sent two additional emails to customer service. Again, we received two boilerplate apologizes and explanations about how shipping timeframes aren't guarantees but estimates. But stretching 24 hours into 240 hours seems too big a mistake for just being a problem in estimation.In one of our emails with Amazon, we requested a phone number so we could speak with someone about this issue. As some of you have already mentioned, Amazon doesn't make a phone number available on its web site, but fortunately Amazon did provide it when asked--the number is 1-800-201-7575, by the way, in the US and Canada, not that it will do you any good. So, next, we called customer service at Amazon to find out what was going on with our shipment. Finally, we found out that because we selected Super Saver shipping that our order was supposed to be delayed 3-5 days, though the service rep couldn't account for why the order had been delayed for 10 days. She also couldn't point us to a place on the Amazon web site where it mentions that Super Saver shipments take longer to ship out. She said, ""I think it's in a pop-up somewhere."" After navigating the site again, we did discover a link (not a pop-up) that mentions Super Saver shipments are delayed 3-5 days, but we believe such a statement should be made prominently when the user selects the preferred shipping method. In addition, availability and delivery estimates should be adjusted to reflect this shipment option.We asked this customer service rep if we could speak with a manager. She said we could but told us we'd have to call back because she couldn't work the phones to transfer the call.When we did call back, we spoke to a manager (which Amazon calls an ""order specialist""). We reached Leroy, who, when we asked why our shipment had been delayed more than 3-5 days, said, ""I have no idea. I'm not in distribution."" He was puzzled why we'd be concerned about the delay: ""The shipment's only a few days late. That's not too bad."" He offered only a $5 discount on our next purchase as compensation for the error, although he already knew by this point we'd never order from Amazon again. Some compensation!I asked Leroy if I could speak with his supervisor, and he said I could but she wasn't in. He told me that his supervisor, Marsha, would call me the next evening, and that I couldn't call her because she doesn't have a phone number. I asked him if he was certain Marsha would call us the next evening. He guaranteed she would. So I waited around the next evening, but Marsha never returned my call.Honestly, I have never dealt with a more inept company than Amazon.com. If you ever have any difficulties with an order, don't expect a direct answer, and don't expect anyone to resolve the issue to your satisfaction. And, if you select Super Saver shipping, don't expect to receive your items when they're supposed to arrive. We finally received part of our shipment on September 4, and the remainder is supposed to come sometime next week--Leroy guaranteed it, for what his word's worth. At this point, my wife and I have agreed to send all the items back and buy them from a more reputable reseller, even if doing so means paying more money. We hope never to deal with Amazon again."
"I purchased a radeon 7500 aiw on august 5.  Wasn't in big rush for card because it was for a second computer I was still assembling.  On August 26th I get a email from the saying that my order was delayed.  21 days for them to tell me it was delayed for a video card that was in stock, and also in stock at circuit city.  Thats a very long 24 hr expected ship time.  Looked for 20 min trying to find a contact phone number so I could at least yell at someone, lo and behold, no phone number.  If I could of talked to someone and if they had contacted me a little sooner I might not of cancelled my order.  From now on its Newegg."
"I figured Amazon.com, being such a reputable company, would not cause me any problems but this was not the case.  I tried to apply a gift certificate to my order online, following the exact instructions they have on their website on how to do this.  There was some sort of error though, and the certificate was not applied.  It told me that I could not enter another certificate although it wasn't applying the one I had entered.  Anyways, I decided to call customer service to clear up the issue before my order shipped.  Surprise! They have no number to call.  They only have email assistance.  They figure they must have every possible customer service scenario covered on their customer service page so no need to have phone support!  Anyways, I emailed and explained my situation but they basically blew me off.  They treated me like it was my fault the gift certificate wasn't applied, as if I'm some kind of moron.  I wrote back explaining exactly what I did, which was in accordance with their instructions bit again they emailed me back refusing to apply the gift certificate.Is it me? It's them right?  Obviosuly there is a disagreement.  How hard is it for them to take my gift certificate, which is prepaid revenue to them I might add, and apply it to my order?  Even if I was an idiot and didn't follow instructions, which is not the case here, why are they fighting me on this?  That is poor customer service.  This is the problem with big companies.  Sometimes they just don't give a crap about some tiny customer and try to make them go away once they have your money in hand.  Thanks Amazon.  I'll be back to your site for sure."
"so so customer service, not very impressive. Amazon will take your money by strictly adhering to their policies, even if a grey area was involved. They don't give customers the benefit of the doubt."
This store is shit.
